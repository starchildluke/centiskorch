I wrote about {frontmatter.title} [on my other blog, Distant Arcade](https://distantarcade.co.uk/adefs-quest-to-win-all-8-badges-with-all-the-victory-road-trainers-in-pokemon-firered/), and I thought I'd put the sequel to that video here.

This time, he played through Pokémon Emerald as each of the Victory Road trainers to see if they could genuinely get each badge and make it to the Elite Four. Any trainer who beat the gym leaders without using items got a chance to take on the Elite Four. Some item use meant they earnt their place in Victory Road and nothing more. But those who failed the challenge were labelled frauds.
