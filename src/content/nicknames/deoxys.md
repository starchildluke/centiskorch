Deoxys was introduced in Generation 3 with a pure Psychic typing so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames. It is notably for having four formes (seen above):

* Normal Forme
* Attack Forme
* Defense Forme
* Speed Forme

Let's look at some info on Deoxys and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Deoxys is an alien Pokémon with simian-like features (at least to me). It's bipedal, mainly a tomato/orange red with some of its features and its "double helix" arm strands being a light gray blue colour.

Deoxys was born from a space virus after expsoure to a laser beam and is highly intelligent, with its "brain" appearing to be the crystal in its chest which can also shoot lasers (because Pokémon). It can regenerate parts of its body and creates auroras when changing forme, which allow it to communicate with other Deoxys. Aurora-based telekensis is so metal!

Name wise, Deoxys takes inspiration from DNA or **Deoxy**ribonucleic acid.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Deoxys nicknames!

### S-Tier

* **CosmicBOOM** - it's what I called my shiny one and because I developed a headcanon where it is part of the Rillaboom line because this thing reminds me of a monkey so much!

### B-Tier
