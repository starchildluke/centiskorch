Quaquaval was introduced in Generation 9 with a Water/Fighting typing so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames. It is the final evolution of Quaxly, evolving from Quaxwell at level 36.

Let's look at some info on Quaquaval and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Quaquaval is a humanoid Pokémon that resembles a duck and a carnival dancer. It has dark blue plumage with some light blue accents on its tail feathers, collar, and at the end of its forearms. It also has elongated red eyebrows and yellow feet with red bulbous tips on the ends of its toes.

Quaquaval is known for its dancing and its incredible strength, <q cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Quaquaval_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Biology">being able to launch a truck away with a single kick.</q> Interestingly, Quaquaval and Tsareena are rivals.

Etymologically, Quaquaval is a portmanteau of "quack", "aqua" + "carnival", representing it's duck-like features, its Water typing, and its design being based on a carnival dancer. It may also relate to the word "quaquaversal", a geological term meaning to <q cite="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/quaquaversal">slope downward from the center in all directions.</q>

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
