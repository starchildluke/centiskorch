Scolipede was introduced in Generation 5 with a Bug/Poison typing which isn't particularly unique but there's still scope for great nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Scolipede and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Scolipede is basically a purple centipede with a shape that doesn't necessary scream "centipede" like our good friend, [Centiskorch](/nicknames/centiskorch/). It's bulky, stands on four legs(?), and it's a red/magenta/purple kind of colour. And apparently, Centiskorch preys on Scolipede. Uh oh!

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Scolipede nicknames!

### A-Tier

* **Carnage**
* **Siren** - see "Bermuda" for the rationale
* **Bordeaux** - because of the wine colour
* **Merlot** - see above

### B-Tier

* **Slithe**
* **Cholera**
* **Hot Shoes**
* **Tapdance**
* **Jabba/Jabber**
* **Barb** - because it has a 5% chance of holding a Poison Barb in B2/W2
* **Fever**
* **Crimson**
* **Grim/Reaper** - inspired by a GPT-3.5 Turbo suggestion (Grim Reaper)

### C-Tier

* **Bodyodyody**
* **Crouton**
* **Britney** - because Toxic?
* **Prey**
