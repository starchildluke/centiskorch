Jellicent was introduced in Generation 5 with a Water/Ghost dual typing so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Jellicent and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Jellicent is the evolved form of Frillish, evolving at Level 40. It is a dimorphic jellyfish-like Pokémon. Its dimorphism is based on its gender:

* Male Jellicent are blue, with a white moustache-like collar and red eyes on blue scelerae
* Female Jellicent are pink, with a white collar around the neck area and blue eyes on pink scelerae and a visible heart-shaped mouth

Fun fact: the Frillish line was meant to have pure Water typing but the Ghost typing was added "for balancing reasons".

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Jellicent nicknames!
