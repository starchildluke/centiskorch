In July, [Beastcoast](https://www.youtube.com/@beastcoastpokemon) chose 5 "weaker" Pokémon that excelled in Restricted Formats against all odds. I won't reveal them but it's interesting to see which Pokémon have seen notable usage in the Scarlet/Violet era of VGC. Some are thankfully not in the game right now, and one will make a comeback in Legends Z-A and I'll be writing about it in an upcoming blog series. Ooh, cryptic!
