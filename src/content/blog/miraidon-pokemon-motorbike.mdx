If you ever imagined what a real life Miraidon would look like, well, now's the chance. Toyoto made a prototype Miraidon motorcycle at its Waku Waku World even last November, a Toyota-run exhibition in Toyota City in Nagoya.

Besides the main vehicle, they also made some small 3D models and there's footage of them building them all.

Of course, given the size, cost, and lack of sustainable interest, they won't be mass produced. But according to Toyota's PR, they'll be displaying the prototype in Hibiya Midtown on from 15thâ€“17th March (although they deleted the tweet - [here is a screenshot for posterity](https://imgur.com/nwEMzsL))
