Snorlax was introduced in Generation 1 with a Normal typing and a Gigantamax form so there's plenty of inspiration for a nickname.

Let's look at some info on Snorlax and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Snorlax is a big bear-like creature who loves to eat. And its Japanese name (Kabigon) is based on Kirby's Japanese name (<span lang="ja">Kābī</span>). Did I mention that Snorlax loves to eat?

Besides its insatiable appetite, Snorlax also loves to sleep hence the snor- part of its name. A random but interesting fact: Snorlax is the only black Pokémon introduced in Generation I, according to Bulbapedia.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from.
