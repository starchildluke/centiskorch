Ferrothorn was introduced in Generation 5 with a Grass/Steel typing and judging by its appearance, there's a lot to use for nickname inspiration.

Let's have a look at Ferrothorn's origins and some of those nicknames.

## Origins

Ferrothorn is a durian-like Pokémon with a silver metallic body covered in thorns. It has three black horizontal stripes on its body, yellow eyes with green rims around the outside, and three long vines for appendages, each with spikes on the ends.

Name-wise, Ferrothorn is made up of the word ferrous, meaning "something containing iron", and thorn because of its thorns.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Ferrothorn nicknames!
