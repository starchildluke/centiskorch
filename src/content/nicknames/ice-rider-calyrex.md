Ice Rider Calyrex was introduced in Generation 8 with a Psychic/Ice typing so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

It is one of Calyrex's additional forms (along with [Shadow Rider Calyrex](/nicknames/shadow-rider-calyrex/)) which is activated when using the Reins of Unity on Glastrier.

Let's look at some info on Ice Rider Calyrex and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Ice Rider Calyrex is the combination of Calyrex, a lepus-like bipedal Pokémon, and Glastrier, a white horse with an icy crown. The crown-like piece on Calyrex's head <q cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Calyrex_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">glows bright green when it is using its powers</q>.

With Glastrier, Ice Rider Calyrex can ride for seven days and nights thanks to its boosted endurance and emit temperatures as low as −500°F (−300°C or -26.85K).

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from.
