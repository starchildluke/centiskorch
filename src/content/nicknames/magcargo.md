Magcargo was introduced in Generation 2 with a dual Fire/Rock typing. It evolves from Slugma at Level 38.

## Origins

Magcargo is a red snail-like Pokémon with a charcoal-coloured shell, yellow eyes and a flame coming out of its shell. Its internal body temperature can reach over 10,000°C/18,000°F and its shell is so brittle that even the slightest touch can shatter it.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

Also: all [Fire type nicknames](/nicknames/themes/fire-type/) apply here since Magcargo is a Fire type.

With all that said, let's look at those Magcargo nicknames!
