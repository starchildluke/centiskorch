Blastoise was introduced in Generation 1 with a Water typing and a Gigantamax form so there's plenty of inspiration for a nickname.

Let's look at some info on Blastoise and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Blastoise is a giant turtle with water cannons on its back. And half of its name is tortoise. And blast. While it's the final evolution of Squirtle, it may have been a standalone Pokémon with no connection to Squirtle or Wartotle.

There was early concept art for a Pokémon called "Karabajio" which looked a helluva lot like Blastoise but without the water cannons (or maybe they were tucked in, we'll never know). The name looked like a play on Caravaggio as an homage to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles using famous Renassiance artists for their names.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from
