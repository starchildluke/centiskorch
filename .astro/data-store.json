Honda has built a Koraidon motorcycle and the company will present it at the Honda Koraidon Exhibit from Friday, March 7 - Sunday, March 9, 2025.\n\nHere's what the company has said about the project (and a link to the [Honda project page in Japanese](https://global.honda/jp/motorcycle/brand/koraidon/?from=topicslink_text)):\n\n> Honda Koraidon is future mobility created with Honda’s experiences and unique technologies in the shape of Koraidon, a Legendary Pokémon that appears in the game “Pokémon Scarlet,” with the cooperation of The Pokémon Company. Honda has realized an almost life-size reproduction of the shape of Koraidon in both weight and size, down to the finest details.\u003Cbr/>\u003Cbr/>\n> Honda will use its proprietary self-balancing technology to enable Honda Koraidon to walk on all four legs, and self-stand on two-wheels which is unseen in the game. This balance technology world premiered as Honda Riding Assist at CES 2017, the world’s largest consumer electronics trade show, which was developed by applying the self-balancing technology cultivated in ASIMO humanoid robot research. Honda will apply this technology to realize Koraidon’s “Sprinting Build.”\n\nUnlike the in-game Koraidon, this one can actually run on wheels as well as walking on four legs. It's remarkable that we've had no one but two legendaries built using real-life tech. Does that make them mechas? Is there potential for a crossover? Am I clutching at straws?

After knocking out the 60 and resetting the spawns... I finally got one. [2024 IS FOR DRAGONS](/blog/2023-suckers-2024-dragons/)! I named it Pistachio because of its green tint and it was [Pistachio Day](https://cultrface.co.uk/its-pistachio-day/) on 26th.\n\nAnd then there was the [Pokémon Presents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qi4COrQ7aA). The biggest announcements for me were new Gen 1 Tera Raids, TCG Pocket, a new TCG game for mobile and the new Legends game, Pokémon Legends: Z-A.\n\n## Gen 1 Tera Raids\n\nWe're getting Tera Raids for the Gen 1 starters on the following dates:\n\n* Mighty Venusaur - Wednesday, February 28 to Tuesday, March 5\n* Mighty Blastoise - Wednesday, March 6 to Tuesday, March 12\n* Mighty Charizard - Wednesday, March 13 to Sunday, March 17\n\nThe good news is that they drop Herba Mystica at a rate of 3%. As usual, you can only catch them once, they're shiny locked, and for Charizard, if you caught it in December 2022, you can't catch it again.\n\nBlastoise is my all-time fave and the Herba drops are amazing so I'm enjoying them so far. I've beaten Venusaur a few times with a Chesnaught and I'm sure the other raids will be easy to do.\n\n## Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket\n\n[Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket](https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/) (or TCG Pocket for short) will be an iOS and Android game, created by Creatures Inc. and DeNA. In it, you can collect TCG cards via two free booster packs every day and get exclusive cards with some immersive art. You can also play some quick games between devices which looks fun and maybe easier than the full TCG Live platform.\n\nI think TCG Pocket looks like a lot of fun and I like that you can get free stuff (although I'm sure there'll be microtransactions if DeNA are involved). I'm not sure how this will work alongside TCG Live, which also has a mobile app to do much of the same things but time will tell.\n\n## Pokémon Legends: Z-A\n\nAnd last but not least: Pokémon Legends: Z-A.\n\nIt was a curveball that only diehard Gen 6 fans saw coming (apparently) and it left some people disappointed, expecting Gen 5 remakes, a Gen 2 Legends game, or re-releases of the Gen 1 games. All we know so far is that it will be set in an \"urban development area\" of Lumiose City and feature a variety of Gen 6 Pokémon. Oh, and the big one: Megas are coming back!\n\nFor me, I'm hyped. I loved Legends: Arceus and I'd love to experience Gen 6 in a proper 3D format. I only played with Megas in Let's Go so I don't have a deep connection with the mechanic. But I'm looking forward to seeing how the games pan out. I'm not into the myriad of theories and predictions for what we might expect so I will wait and enjoy what comes.\n\nAfter the Pokémon Presents, I decided to go after a shiny Salazzle and after a couple of attempts, I actually got one.

As a Wolfe fan, I've enjoyed them all but having deleted my Twitter at the end of last year, and feeling particularly awful this month because January is always a crap month for my mental health, I needed a pick-me-up and remembered that tweet. And that's when I decided to make my own version:\n\n> 2023 WAS FOR SUCKERS 2024 IS FOR DRAGONS\n\nIs it a rip-off? Yeah, probably. But it's a _topical_ rip-off because 2024 is the Year of the Dragon, according to the Chinese zodiac, and what better way to celebrate than to tie all my mental efforts into dragons and Pokémon. After all, Chinese culture has featured heavily in the franchise, with Pokémon such Emboar, Reshiram, Zekrom, Altaria, and the Treasures of Ruin.\n\nFor the last few weeks, whenever I thought about that mantra, it put a fire in my belly to keep going and power through the darkness. Then tonight, I went on Pokémon Violet for a draft league match (spoiler alert: I lost) and noticed there was a Shelgon outbreak. My mind went back to that motto and I knew what to do:\n\n1. I'd catch two shiny Shelgon\n2. I'd evolve one, and keep the other unevolved\n3. I'd transfer up an [event shiny Bagon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_local_Japanese_event_Pok%C3%A9mon_distributions_(Generation_V)#Bagon) from Pokémon Black\n4. I'd take photos with them and reinforce my 2024 goals, for the aesthetic\n\nSo after the match, I spent the next 3-5 hours searching for a shiny Shelgon. I even tried the Academy Special meal with Level 1 Sparkling Power as I was low on Herba Mystica, but to no avail (unsurprisingly). I also tried to do some 6* Raids to see if I'd get any drops but luck wasn't on my side this time and after a few defeats, I felt like I was wasting precious time and eventually went back to the hunt.\n\nMinutes went by with nothing; spawning and respawning the same regular degular Shelgon...\n\nAnd then, it finally appeared!\n\nI saved and tried to figure out what ball to use. I tried a Quick Ball first, just in case but nothing.\n\n\u003Cq>Maybe a Dive Ball? No. Not an Ultra Ball this time... how about a Dusk Ball? That'll match because Salamence is green and I'm in a cave!\u003C/q>\n\nIt required a Spore + False Swipe combo from my trusty Breloom but I got it and I named her **Charlotte** (as a pun on 'shallot', since I decided to give both Shelgon onion-related names.) It was an ordeal to get one shiny Shelgon—how was I going to find a second? Well, the shiny gods threw me a bone and I found a second one minutes later. I saved, threw a Dusk Ball first time and got the all-important critical capture.

And that’s when I decided to make my own version:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>2023 WAS FOR SUCKERS 2024 IS FOR DRAGONS\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>Is it a rip-off? Yeah, probably. But it’s a \u003Cem>topical\u003C/em> rip-off because 2024 is the Year of the Dragon, according to the Chinese zodiac, and what better way to celebrate than to tie all my mental efforts into dragons and Pokémon. After all, Chinese culture has featured heavily in the franchise, with Pokémon such Emboar, Reshiram, Zekrom, Altaria, and the Treasures of Ruin.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the last few weeks, whenever I thought about that mantra, it put a fire in my belly to keep going and power through the darkness. Then tonight, I went on Pokémon Violet for a draft league match (spoiler alert: I lost) and noticed there was a Shelgon outbreak. My mind went back to that motto and I knew what to do:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>I’d catch two shiny Shelgon\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>I’d evolve one, and keep the other unevolved\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>I’d transfer up an \u003Ca href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_local_Japanese_event_Pok%C3%A9mon_distributions_(Generation_V)#Bagon\">event shiny Bagon\u003C/a> from Pokémon Black\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>I’d take photos with them and reinforce my 2024 goals, for the aesthetic\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>So after the match, I spent the next 3-5 hours searching for a shiny Shelgon. I even tried the Academy Special meal with Level 1 Sparkling Power as I was low on Herba Mystica, but to no avail (unsurprisingly). I also tried to do some 6* Raids to see if I’d get any drops but luck wasn’t on my side this time and after a few defeats, I felt like I was wasting precious time and eventually went back to the hunt.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Minutes went by with nothing; spawning and respawning the same regular degular Shelgon…\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And then, it finally appeared!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I saved and tried to figure out what ball to use.

It was an ordeal to get one shiny Shelgon—how was I going to find a second? Well, the shiny gods threw me a bone and I found a second one minutes later. I saved, threw a Dusk Ball first time and got the all-important critical capture.

This comes in handy when the Pokémon is red/orange/yellow, already in my Pokédex, and I have Repeat Balls. But for legendaries (outside of Tera Raids where the catch rate is 100% on all balls), it's a little trickier.\n\nMy latest attempt was at catching Lunala in a Moon Ball (because aesthetic). If you're wondering where Lunala is located in Pokémon Violet, it's on the west coast of Paldea, north of Porto Marinada at the edge of a cliff ([this YouTube video by astephen68 should help you find the precise location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5hFqMuk1Xk)).

Lunala's regular catch rate is 3 (or 1.567% with a Poké Ball at full health) so better but not great.

Because of that, I just used Brutus's Bullet Seed, hoped it wouldn't hit 5 times and KO (spoiler alert: it did a few times), put it to sleep and throw balls. This strategy didn't work.\n\nPlan B was a little more involved. I still used Brutus's Bullet Seed strat but swapped into SprayCharles when it was in the yellow to Icy Wind and Yawn before throwing balls. I got some triple jiggles but they all broke out. Damn you!

Kinda. So you might be thinking \"why would you use a middle stage evolution instead of [Poliwrath](/nicknames/poliwrath/) or Politoed?\" Well, Poliwhirl gets access to Eviolite which gives it more bulk than Poliwrath. It also gets abilities like Swift Swim and Water Absorb which, depending on your strat, can give you extra speed with your support or extra support with your support. The latter will be particularly hand for switching into Urshifu Surging Strikes. I was looking for an example of Eviolite Poliwhirl and found [a team made by Pokésports for the SwSh ladder back in Series 12 last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5mBkSxKTLY). It wasn't the best showcase but [you can check out the Poképaste for move/spread ideas](https://pokepast.es/28751d2acb2c0ea9).\n\nPoliwrath is an alternative Water/Fighting type to Urshifu if you want... more special defense I guess? Okay, so it's not a _good_ alternative but maybe you could give it a Choice item, pair it with a Tornadus with Rain Dance and Tailwind, give it Poison Jab and hey presto, it's a Flutter Mane counter! What do you mean I'm clutching at straws???\n\nFinally, we have Politoed and I actually have a history with the big frog as I used it a lot as my rain setter before Kyogre was allowed in SwSh VGC. Besides having Drizzle, it's also very bulky and a great support Pokémon with a lot of great support moves and disruptive moves like Encore, Icy Wind, and Perish Song if you're into that style of play. I managed to get some shiny Poliwag which I evolved so I have access to shiny forms of all of these.\n\n## 2. Snorlax\n\u003Cdiv class=\"img-center\" style=\"margin-top:1rem;\">\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/sprites/gen1/snorlax_143_rby.png\" alt=\"Snorlax\" width=\"56px\" height=\"56px\"/>\n\u003C/div>\n\n[Snorlax](/nicknames/snorlax/) has defined metas in the past and it's a great choice for extreme bulk and attack. And let's not forget that wide movepool and it'll be interesting to see how it fares in SV.\n\n## 3. Sentret\n\nSentret, for all intents and purposes, sucks in VGC. Even in Little Cup it sucks. But I thought: what if I tried it anyway? And so I theorycrafted a team:\n\n**Sentret @ Focus Sash  \nAbility: Frisk  \nLevel: 50  \nEVs: 252 Atk  \nAdamant Nature**  \n\n**\\- Protect  \n\\- Sucker Punch  \n\\- Helping Hand  \n\\- Follow Me/Baby Doll Eyes** \n\nIt also gets Trick so you could try some Choice item swapping? It's silly. But I'm in the mood for silliness in Reg E.\n\n## 4. Milotic\n\nMilotic was a PAIN in SwSh. It had Competitive, Scald, Coil, and it ultimately wouldn't leave the field. Now it's my turn to try it. I'm not sure on the accessibility of Scald but it'll be a welcome addition to the game with its power and burn chance. And with Intimidate still around, there's a lot of opportunity for Milotic to make a name for itself again.\n\n## 5. Dusclops\n\nDusclops was also a PAIN in SwSh. It was a key Trick Room setter and would frustrate players who couldn't get rid of it. Cresselia has been a good bulk TR Pokémon but Dusclops + Eviolite knocks it off the top spot in terms of bulk (to compensate for its abysmal HP).\n\n## 6. Yanmega\n\nYanmega intrigues me. It has decent speed and special offense and access to moves like Bug Buzz, Air Slash, Hypnosis, Screech, Shadow Ball... I'm clutching at straws again. But it does also get Speed Boost and that gave Ninjask a niche in SwSh so there's hope for the big bug.\n\n## 7. Conkeldurr\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"img-center\" style=\"margin-top:1rem;\">\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/sprites/gen5/conkeldurr.png\" alt=\"Conkeldurr\" width=\"96px\" height=\"96px\"/>\n\u003C/div>\n\nAs I wrote on [my Gen 5 faves page](/favourites/my-favourite-gen-5-pokemon/), I have a soft spot for Conkeldurr and I'd like to try it on ladder having seen what Wolfe Glick win an International Challenge with it in May 2020 and well, everyone else from 2011–2021. It's built a bit like Ursaluna with its super high attack, high HP and defense and slow speed. And it gets Guts. Like Ursaluna. But Iron Fists is also an option to boost its punching moves like Drain Punch. The possibilities are endless here.\n\n## 8. Chandelure\n\n\u003Cdiv class=\"img-center\" style=\"margin-top:1rem;\">\n\t\u003Cimg src=\"/images/sprites/gen5/chandelure.png\" alt=\"Chandelure\" width=\"96px\" height=\"96px\"/>\n\u003C/div>\n\nMy flaming chandelier is back and ready to cause ghostly havoc on the meta. It's a glass cannon for sure but it's a powerful one at that. It's worth noting that Chandelure has a stronger Shadow Ball and more defence than Flutter Mane but that's where the comparisons end. It's a frail baby but maybe it could do something in the meta.\n\n## 9. Trevenant\n\nThe ghostly tree, the undead Sudowoodo—Trevenant is back and it's ready to Harvest and Horn Leech the meta. It's also another Ghost/Grass type to counter Urshifu, in the spot that Brambleghast has been occupying since everyone jumped on that bandwagon a few weeks ago. It's Attack is only 5 points less than the spectral tumbleweed but it's bulkier, albeit slower. I think we'll see some use of this thing and it'll disrupt matches in the right hands.\n\n## 10. Charjabug/Vikavolt\n\nSo apparently Eviolite Charjabug was a thing back in the day and I'd love to try it now. It also has the ability Battery which boosts allies' special attack by 1.3x, which is a free Life Orb without the recoil. Unlike, say, Stonjourner, Charjabug is way bulkier and can stick around longer to maybe add further power to its partner with Helping Hand, provide speed control with Sticky Web or Thunder Wave, or set up screens. Or Screech. There's a lot to go on here if you wanted to try this little thing.\n\nAnd last but not least, it's Vikavolt. I used one in my Ultra sun playthrough and it's a beast. 145 Special Attack on a Bug type? That's more than Volcarona. Unfortunately, it's quite frail and very slow (45 Spe) so maybe it could be have Focus Sash and cause chaos in Trick Room? The potential is there anyway.\n\nWhat would you like to use in Reg E.

It also gets abilities like Swift Swim and Water Absorb which, depending on your strat, can give you extra speed with your support or extra support with your support. The latter will be particularly hand for switching into Urshifu Surging Strikes.

Pokémon Crystal Legacy isn't the first Crystal mod I've played but it's certainly one of the best.\n\nCrystal Legacy was created by YouTuber and self-proclaimed \"Gen 2 nerd\" [SmithPlays Pokémon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzSgKn6BC9uYD89Hfut3sBg) as a way of making a version that lives up to Gen 2's hidden potential. It's well known that for all its nostalgic charm, Gold/Silver/Crystal has a lot of flaws and missed opportunities such as:\n\n* terrible level scaling in key parts of the games\n* slow grinding\n* a lack of Gen 2 Pokémon in gym leaders' teams\n* a less-than-competitive post-game\n* a final boss battle with Red that is super difficult if you haven't got your team up to Level 70+\n\nBut Crystal Legacy fixes a lot of this with hand-picked changes that bring the games into the modern day.\n\nI played Crystal Legacy on my new Powkiddy RGB30 and, thanks to speed up, I got through it in a few days and I went with a team of Pokémon I generally don't use:\n\n* Hostgator the Feraligatr\u003Csup>\u003Ca href=\"#ref-1\">1\u003C/a>\u003C/sup>\n* Angelfire the Magcargo\n* Lycos the Crobat\n* Tiscali the Beedrill\n* Netscape the Skarmory\n* Winzip the Vileplume\n\nI decided not to play a Nuzlocke so I could enjoy the game but I think adding that element would make this ROM hack even better than it already is.\n\nWhat I liked about the mod was how it changed just enough to get the most of an already good game. The moveset changes meant Pokémon had a better chance to do well throughout the game, such as Beedrill which I could finally use in a playthrough. Probably my favourite story change is how you have to beat the Elite Four for a second time after winning all the Kanto badges. This allows for a better level grinding experience before taking on Red, which was my least favourite part of Gen 2 so I'm glad this was corrected.\n\nSome Pokémon got bigger stat buffs including Magcargo, which I didn't realise until I started writing this review so I chose well for my team! I also enjoyed the improved storyline with Team Rocket which I already found quite entertaining as a kid but this brought it closer to the kind of storylines in Gen 5 (albeit nowhere near as engaging).\n\nYour Rival's storyline is the same but has changes to his team depending on your starter choice.

The moveset changes meant Pokémon had a better chance to do well throughout the game, such as Beedrill which I could finally use in a playthrough. Probably my favourite story change is how you have to beat the Elite Four for a second time after winning all the Kanto badges.

It's not a new concept for The Pokémon Company or The Pokémon Company International and yet everything feels like it's in beta with quality of life improvements only trickling through every so often. VGC should be way better than this. And it's not the fault of the event staff; no, I'm laying blame on the top brass - The Pokémon Company.\n\n## I'm not lovin' it\n\nNow, a brief tangent: I saw a really good film a few years ago called [The Founder](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-founder/) about how McDonald's became a multi-billion dollar enterprise. McDonald's sells franchises to prospective owners and makes money of the real estate (in fact, most of their income comes from rent, royalties, and fees).\n\nThat's how The Pokémon Company feels to me.\n\n## Worlds was a mess\n\nThe Pokémon Company International is a subsidary created by TPC to handle \"brand management, licensing, marketing, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the animated TV series, home entertainment, and the official Pokémon website\". It also manages VGC in every region except Asia. That's because TPC handles Asia and I use \"handle\" very loosely. Staff and organisers have struggled with logistic, organisational, and equipment issues because the people and the hardware just isn't there. Worlds in Japan was supposed to be a monumentous ocassion for all the right reasons but it was an incredible mess. [People were regularly disconnected](https://www.si.com/esports/pokemon/mass-disconnects-threaten-competitive-integrity-at-pok%c3%a9mon-world-championship), there was a sudden death match (which is supposed to be rare), [there was a lot of disqualifications due to genned/hacked Pokémon](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-players-disqualified-from-world-championships-for-using-hacked-pokemon/), [the queues to even get in were hours long in unbearable heat](https://twitter.com/JamesWBaek/status/1697671974489821569), people didn't get their competitor passes or free merch in time. And I'm saying all this as an outsider but the frustration from competitors was real.\n\n## Keeping up appearances\n\nI don't have any solutions. I'm not going to discuss the genning situation because it's honestly boring, the arguments are circular and everyone just argues with false equivalences and faulty morals. It's a game based on data where we reset until we get what we want, let's not forget that. But given TPC's experience and income, there's no excuse for these issues **if they really care about VGC as a competitive element of the business and brand**. It's meant to have a space in eSports and yet it feels like a little sibling trying to join in with their older sibling's games with their mates. And I know TPC doesn't make money off this and that is arguably the main reason why it feels so hands off. But it's branded in a differing light. We get hype from the streams, cool graphics to announce new regulations, more active mentions of VGC in the game itself related to EVs and moves. Maybe it's a free advertising space for them that volunteers, spectators, and competitors pay to keep up. But I digress.\n\nMy ramble is over and anyone who reads this will probably have opinions which I'm welcome to hear if you want to email me. If I've got any facts wrong, I'll correct them. If we don't agree on an opinion, that's all good! Just don't talk to me about genning.

It’s not a new concept for The Pokémon Company or The Pokémon Company International and yet everything feels like it’s in beta with quality of life improvements only trickling through every so often.

It also manages VGC in every region except Asia. That’s because TPC handles Asia and I use “handle” very loosely. Staff and organisers have struggled with logistic, organisational, and equipment issues because the people and the hardware just isn’t there. Worlds in Japan was supposed to be a monumentous ocassion for all the right reasons but it was an incredible mess. \u003Ca href=\"https://www.si.com/esports/pokemon/mass-disconnects-threaten-competitive-integrity-at-pok%c3%a9mon-world-championship\">People were regularly disconnected\u003C/a>, there was a sudden death match (which is supposed to be rare), \u003Ca href=\"https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-players-disqualified-from-world-championships-for-using-hacked-pokemon/\">there was a lot of disqualifications due to genned/hacked Pokémon\u003C/a>, \u003Ca href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesWBaek/status/1697671974489821569\">the queues to even get in were hours long in unbearable heat\u003C/a>, people didn’t get their competitor passes or free merch in time.

I’m not going to discuss the genning situation because it’s honestly boring, the arguments are circular and everyone just argues with false equivalences and faulty morals. It’s a game based on data where we reset until we get what we want, let’s not forget that. But given TPC’s experience and income, there’s no excuse for these issues \u003Cstrong>if they really care about VGC as a competitive element of the business and brand\u003C/strong>. It’s meant to have a space in eSports and yet it feels like a little sibling trying to join in with their older sibling’s games with their mates. And I know TPC doesn’t make money off this and that is arguably the main reason why it feels so hands off. But it’s branded in a differing light. We get hype from the streams, cool graphics to announce new regulations, more active mentions of VGC in the game itself related to EVs and moves. Maybe it’s a free advertising space for them that volunteers, spectators, and competitors pay to keep up.

This list will undoubtedly change over time as I play more of these games and as new games get released. Therefore, these positions won't stick (except for the top 3; [those are laminated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOWAggYhgHQ).)\n\nNote: One asterisk means I've not played it, two asterisks means I'm currently playing it.\n\n## 1. Gen 2\n\n**Games**: Gold/Silver/Crystal\n\n**Score**: 9.5/10\n\n**My thoughts**: It built on everything I loved about Gen I and made it such an enjoyable gen. You got to go back to Kanto, which thrilled me as a kid. All the new Pokémon were cute and cool and interesting at the time (and arguably still are for the most part). Plus, we've since got some new variants and evolutions since then which have made them even cooler.\n\nI also love Johto as a region. Game Freak really dug deep into the Japanese lore, which I appreciated. Yes, the level scaling after the Elite 4 wasn't great and the fact that so many gym leaders didn't use Gen II Pokémon was a poor decision but hey, you could still catch them and fight them elsewhere. And I'm sure people wouldn't have complained *too* much if Clair didn't have her Kingdra at the end.\n\nIf I had one significant gripe, it'd be that grinding is beyond frustrating&mdash;especially if you're doing a Nuzlocke\n\n## 2. Gen 1\n\n**Games**: Red/Green*/Blue/Yellow\n\n**Score**: 9/10\n\n**My thoughts**: It's the gen that started it all. I have some of the fondest memories of playing Blue as a kid and I always go back to it when I need an easy playthrough. A lot of my favourite Pokémon are from the first games and while the bugs and glitches aren't ideal, they give the games a certain charm that were of their time. You can also give them exceptions due to the extreme working conditions that Game Freak made Gen 1 under (and that would continue into the present; looking at you, [Gen IX!](#6-gen-ix))\n\n## 3. Gen 8\n\n**Games**: Sword/Shield/Legends: Arceus/Brilliant Diamond**/Shining Pearl\n\n**Score**: 8.5/10\n\n**My thoughts**: People HATED Gen 8. I was not one of them. They were the most fun I'd had in the franchise since the Gen 6 remakes and, excluding them, the first 2 gens. The Pokémon were fun, the stadium battles were awesome, Dynamax was a fun mechanic (until I hated it in VGC), it introduced me to Centiskorch. Gen 8 was great! I like to ignore the DP remakes but Legends: Arceus was also an incredible game and I wish they'd gone in that direction for Scarlet/Violet. Alas, they didn't but Gen 8 is a firm Top 3 generation as far as I'm concerned.\n\n## 4. Gen 5\n\n**Games**: Black/White/Black 2/White 2\n\n**Score**: 7.5/10\n\n**My thoughts**: This used to be at the bottom of the list because I really didn't enjoy Black and White. However, Game Freak did the thing with Black 2/White 2. It felt like a modern JRPG and they went hard with the dragon-mech-dystopia lore in a way I didn't expect. The cutscenes aren't too invasive and the bits with the frigate and the Kyurem vs Reshiram/Zekrom are spectactular. \u003Cdel>That said, I still don't like BW so that's why it's down here.\u003C/del>\n\nAnd now I like BW. Just needed me to emulate the games on a 720p screen with speed up and a better team to enjoy it.\n\n## 5. Gen 9 \n\n**Games**: Scarlet/Violet**\n\n**Score**: 7.5/10\n\n**My thoughts**: At the time of writing this (2023), Gen 9 is the current gen and I've enjoyed most of it but the bugs and lagging in SV has been annoying over time. They also seemed to peak quite early in terms of the main game and having to wait for more content in the DLCs. The first DLC felt like a glorified expansion pack and was done in a matter of hours. I'm excited for the second DLC but mainly for the returning Pokémon and new Paradox forms/regional variants/divergent Pokémon. It's another case of time will tell and, if there are Gen 5 remakes next, this placing could go way up or come crashing down.\n\n## 6. Gen 3\n\n**Games**: Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald/FireRed/LeafGreen\n\n**Score**: 7/10\n\n**My thoughts**: Gen 3 has suffered from better gens succeeding it. Truth be told, it wouldn't have been higher than 3rd even if I made this list in 2004, but the nostalgia doesn't hold up as well as the other games. Emerald is objectively than Ruby and Sapphire and it was an enjoyable playthrough. And FireRed/LeafGreen were nice revisits to Kanto (and the game I played my greatest Nuzlocke run of all time). \n\n## 7. Gen 4\n\n**Games**: Diamond*/Pearl*/Platinum/HeartGold/SoulSilver\n\n**Score**: 7.5/10\n\n**My thoughts**: Generation 4 has been a gen of two halves. I didn't play DPP until a few weeks ago (Platinum) so my only experience was HGSS, and I adored those games. As you've seen, Gen 2 is my all-time gen and seeing it recreated on the DS in 3D in such expanse was phenomenal. However, when I finally got round to playing and completing Platinum, I didn't feel the same way. I purposely skipped Diamond/Pearl because I knew how slow they were and that Platinum was the superior game, and that was true. But it felt long-winded and didn't captivate me like the Gen 2 remakes. To all those Gen 4 lovers, sorry not sorry!\n\n## 8. Gen 6 \n\n**Games**: X/Y/Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire\n\n**Score**: 6.5/10\n\n**My thoughts**: Gen 6 has a similar problem to Gen 4 in that the remakes made up for the main series games in terms of my enjoyment. I loved ORAS. I thought X/Y was just okay. It was Game Freak's first foray into 3D for the main series but it felt like too much and not as refined as it should have been. And the lag during battles was real (a sign of things to come...). ORAS was lots of fun and, like HGSS, improved on the base games with quality of life improvements and extra content.\n\n## 9. Gen 7\n\n**Games**: Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon\n\n**Score**: 5/10\n\n**My thoughts**: There has to be a loser and it honestly wasn't hard to put Gen 7 at the bottom. SM/USUM suffered greatly from a bloated storyline with way too many cut scenes that stilted my enjoyment of the games. There were plenty of good Pokémon but the poor gameplay outweighed them.\n\nAnd if you want to know what [my favourite Pokémon games](/favourites/my-favourite-pokemon-games/) are, I have a page for that too!","src/content/favourites/my-favourite-pokemon-gens.md","0a156430bfbc5cf8",{"html":677,"metadata":678},"\u003Cp>I thought I’d compile a list of my favourite Pokémon generations.

They also seemed to peak quite early in terms of the main game and having to wait for more content in the DLCs. The first DLC felt like a glorified expansion pack and was done in a matter of hours. I’m excited for the second DLC but mainly for the returning Pokémon and new Paradox forms/regional variants/divergent Pokémon. It’s another case of time will tell and, if there are Gen 5 remakes next, this placing could go way up or come crashing down.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"6-gen-3\">6.

However, when I finally got round to playing and completing Platinum, I didn’t feel the same way. I purposely skipped Diamond/Pearl because I knew how slow they were and that Platinum was the superior game, and that was true. But it felt long-winded and didn’t captivate me like the Gen 2 remakes.

I already loved tortoises (one of my favourite animals) so seeing one in one of my favourite colours with cool water cannons on its back, it was a dream to witness.\n\nIn Scarlet and Violet, I have a shiny Blastoise called SprayCharles (taken from my [Blastoise nickname page](/nicknames/blastoise/)) with a defensive build and I love him so much! The Gen 9 overworld animation is awesome too as Blastoise sprays its cannons as it swims, perfect for auto-battling in bodies of water.

I've got to say the games I've played so far have been a lot of fun.

You're joined by a group of party members that differ between games but are regularly comprised of male and female characters.\n\nAs it's an RPG, you get classic turn-based combat (with the exception of some spin-offs and Dragon Quest X), recurring monsters via random encounters, and themes of imperialism and monarchism.\n\n## Slime!\n\nI love Slime and its entire family.

S is the best and D is the worst.\n* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from\n\nWith all that said, let's look at those Centiskorch nicknames!\n\n### S-Tier\n\n* **Flare Jordan** - Ooh, I like that one! Based on Air Jordan if you didn't know\n* **Forge** - you can't forge without fire!\n* **Crossfire** - There's a cross on its mouth and, you know, fire.\n* **Hector** - \"Hecto-\" is Greek for 100. Centi- is Latin for 100. And I read this nickname in Gus Fring's voice which makes it funnier.\n* **Box Box** - My son called his Sizzlipede this and the random cuteness makes it an Ubers pick by default. Not sorry, I DO make the rules around here!\n* **Ricochet**\n\n### A-Tier\n\n* **Firecracker** - The one I used for my Centiskorch. It felt fitting given it's G-Max form.\n* **Mustang** - FullMetal Alchemist fans should recognised this name with the click of a finger\n* **Paprika** - it's a red pepper spice, nuff said!\n* **Cayenne** - hot stuff coming through!\n* **Queen Pede** - based on the character from the Atari classic, Centipede\n* **Soot** - based on the Alpha Centipede from Nintendo game, Centipede: Infestation\n* **Scoot** - I dunno, it just fits.\n* **Colgera**\n* **Therma**\n* **Fire Whip**\n* **Colossus**\n\n### B-Tier\n\n* **Flameboy** - [Thank Phoebe from Friends for that idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7o7By0FlDU)\n* **Mushu** - A common nickname idea, based on the Chinese dragon from the movie Mulan\n* **Garet** - If you're a Golden Sun fan, you may remember Garet as the Fire Adept\n* **Borlotto** - The borlotti bean has a cultivar called Borlotto Lingua di Fuoco or \"Tongue of Fire\". You can work the rest out\n* **Kindle** - v. set (something) on fire.\n* **Rebbie** - [Rebbie Jackson's hit song was Centipede](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8SdzwoIcwo)!\n* **Smaug** - the fire breathing dragon from Lord of the Rings\n* **Pepper** - it's a real name and a hot one too!\n* **Heartburn** - not a comfortable feeling, let me tell ya!\n* **Cacus** - Cacus was the fire-breathing son of Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. And he was a giant!\n* **Vulcan**\n* **Dhalsim** - he can breathe fire, apparently\n* **Crimson** - shade of red\n* **Wildfire** - some centipedes live in forests and I could see a Centiskorch living up to this name\n* **FastFootFred** - Another language model suggestion. It's so out there and I kinda love it.\n* **Millie** - not a millipede. Not a millipede!!!\n* **Atari** - see \"Queen Pede\" above\n* **Fahrenheit**\n* **Hephaestus**\n* **Obelisk**\n* **Gazpacho**\n\n### C-Tier\n\n* **Pesto** - pesto can be red... that's all I've got and now I'm hungry\n* **Chargrilled** - You could probably grill burgers on a Centiskorch. I wouldn't though.\n* **Spain** - They have a red flag but the main inspiration came from Sir Francis Drake who was said to have \"figuratively 'singed the King of Spain's beard' when he raided Cadiz and burnt the Spanish fleet.\" I could see Centiskorch doing that.\n* **Burn Notice** - I just love the show lol\n* **Blacklist** - Fire burns and turns things black. Sorry, still thinking about Burn Notice\n* **Fuego** - Spanish for fire\n* **Corona** - not the virus\n* **Inferno** - It's G-Max move is Centiferno. Maybe a little on the nose? I'll leave that up to you.\n* **WrigglysXtra** - like the chewing gum, geddit?\n* **Hello Legs**\n* **Predator**\n* **ScotchBonnet**\n* **Pagoda**\n* **Merlot**\n* **Stove**\n* **Toaster**\n* **Salsa**\n* **Heatwave**\n* **Agate**\n\n### D-Tier\n\n* **Radiator** - A bit reductive perhaps but it was based on a radiator, so...\n* **FrancisDrake** - see \"Spain\"\n* **Glowworm** - I know it's not a worm but it does glow\n* **Fentyskorch** - would you put makeup on a flaming centipede?\n* **Turmeric**\n* **Cinnamon**\n* **Forgefiend**\n* **Skewer**\n\nDo you have a favourite Centiskorch nickname or have a suggestion of your own?

As it spits strings of webs, that characteristic comes from spitting spiders (Scytodidae).\n\nName-wise, it could be a mix of Ariadne, a princess from Greek mythology, which lead to terms like arachnid (the Latin for spider), and _maybe_ dos for two because it was the second Pokémon in its evolutionary line and it has two stinger thingies on its back?

It is notably for having four formes (seen above):\n\n* Normal Forme\n* Attack Forme\n* Defense Forme\n* Speed Forme\n\nLet's look at some info on Deoxys and suggested nicknames.\n\n## Origins\n\nDeoxys is an alien Pokémon with simian-like features (at least to me). It's bipedal, mainly a tomato/orange red with some of its features and its \"double helix\" arm strands being a light gray blue colour.\n\nDeoxys was born from a space virus after expsoure to a laser beam and is highly intelligent, with its \"brain\" appearing to be the crystal in its chest which can also shoot lasers (because Pokémon). It can regenerate parts of its body and creates auroras when changing forme, which allow it to communicate with other Deoxys. Aurora-based telekensis is so metal!\n\nName wise, Deoxys takes inspiration from DNA or **Deoxy**ribonucleic acid.\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.\n* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from\n\nWith all that said, let's look at those Deoxys nicknames!\n\n### S-Tier\n\n* **CosmicBOOM** - it's what I called my shiny one and because I developed a headcanon where it is part of the Rillaboom line because this thing reminds me of a monkey so much!\n* **Helix**\n* **Aurora**\n* **Kin** - from tele**kin**esis\n* **Legion** - [after the character from Red Dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legion_(Red_Dwarf))\n\n### A-Tier\n\n* **DeNA** - it's a name!\n* **Tube Man** - [Wacky Waving Inflatable Arm-Flailing Tubeman!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHXvMcLrLSY)\n* **Astro**\n* **Iron Man** - crystal-like organ in its chest?

Its body is brown, and it has a yellow, green, and red crest on its head\">\u003C/div>\n\nGouging Fire was introduced in Generation 9 with a Fire/Dragon typing based on [Entei](/nicknames/entei/) so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.\n\nLet's look at some info on Gouging Fire and suggested nicknames.\n\n## Origins\n\nGouging Fire is a dinosaur-like, hybrid Pokémon with both canine and feline features. It has brown fur, like Entei, with three green spike lines on its back legs, cream fur on its chest, and five grey spikes on its back. There are black cuffs around its ankles and it has a predominately yellow crest on its head, with green and red in the centre. Honestly, look up Entei and just add more colour, fur, and prehistoric features.\n\nGouging Fire is said to be an ancient Pokémon that is related to Entei but also could be an ancient _version_ of Entei from an alternate timeline.

Its head appears to be fused into its torso, therefore lacking a prominent neck. The collar area is a black band, it has two prodding fin-like parts coming out of its back and horns shaped like blades with thick golden yellow edges. Iron Boulder's four hooves are also cuffed in golden yellow with white sparkles.\n\nAs Iron Boulder is based on Terrakion, it appears to be a mix of various bovid species such as long-horned sheep, bulls, and the [takin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takin).\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D.

It has pink lips and differs from Magmar with its almost clown-like flaming \"hair\" coming out of the top and sides of its head. Another notable difference is the cannons that come out of its arms (Armarouge has a similar design but its cannon comes from its armour when both hands are combined).\n\nLike Magby and Magmar, Magmortar takes inspiration from the booby (a seabird) and ducks. It may also be inspired by the karura, a divine Japanese mythological creature which has a human body and birdlike head and is said to breath fire.\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.\n* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from\n\nWith all that said, let's look at those Magmortar nicknames!\n\n### S-Tier\n\n* **Apokolips** - okay, so hear me out. When I was a kid, I thought Apocalypse in the X-Men animated series was called that because of his lips (ApocaLIPS). Then I find out years later that there's a planet called Apokolips and get confused. And now it's 2023 and I think Apokolips is a great name because of Magmortar's lips. The end.\n* **Garet** - after Garet from Golden Sun. Automatically S-Tier because I named my Magmortar \"Garet\" in my [Black 2/White 2 playthrough](/logs/my-pokemon-teams/)\n\n### A-Tier\n\n* **Gauge** - a gun pun\n* **Fuze** - a device that ignites the charge of a cannon's projectile\n* **Oppenheimer** - too soon?\n* **Krusty** - because, look at it!\n* **Backfire**\n* **Stromboli** - a volcano in Italy.

Another notable difference is the cannons that come out of its arms (Armarouge has a similar design but its cannon comes from its armour when both hands are combined).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Like Magby and Magmar, Magmortar takes inspiration from the booby (a seabird) and ducks.

However, this isn't just any old rag—the rag is shaped and styled to look like Pikachu (including a brown stick at the back acting as the tail). It's unknown what Mimikyu looks like under there but we do know it has long, black claw-like appendages that come out from under the rag to attack.\n\nIt's said that its eyes glow yellow when irritated.

It is grey, has a humanoid shape, and has a long, purple tail (green if it's shiny). It has two stumpy horn-like protusions, purple eyes and a tube that connects its head to its neck.\n\nMewtwo also has two Mega evolution forms: [Mega Mewtwo X](https://sg.portal-pokemon.com/play/pokedex/0150_1) and [Mega Mewtwo Y](https://sg.portal-pokemon.com/play/pokedex/0150_2).\n\nAt the time of its creation, Mewtwo was one of the most powerful Pokémon in the Pokémon World and still remains strong in the face of other legendaries in the franchise. It has featured extensively in the anime (both the series and multiple films) and the manga and has a deep hatred of humans due to how it was created and subsquently treated. An example of this is when Mewtwo escape Dr Fuji's lab, where it was created, and worked for Giovanni of Team Rocket. He was placed in a mecha suit and used to beat trainers in Giovanni's Viridian City gym. When Mewtwo realised it was working FOR Giovanni rather than WITH him, he broke from his restraints and journeyed to a new island to create his own land of Pokémon clones away from humans.\n\nIn the games, diaries found in the Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island stated that Mewtwo was born in the Guyanan jungles. Scientists then took Mewtwo and held it captive in the Mansion before studying the Pokémon. Eventually, it broke free and found the Cerulean Cave where it lives in the Kanto games (RBY, FRLG, and LGPE).\n\nName-wise, Mewtwo is literally Mew + two, signifying its cloned status of Mew. By association, Mew may also reference the sound a cat makes due to both of their feline features.\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.\n* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from\n\nWith all that said, let's look at those Mewtwo nicknames!\n\n### S-Tier\n\n* **Frieza** - standard, and probably the most common nickname\n* **Genesis**\n* **Oracle**\n* **The Catalyst**\n\n### A-Tier\n\n* **MechaMewtwo** - as above, referenced from the anime and first movie\n* **Embryo**\n* **Gene Kelly**\n* **Copycat**\n* **HelixTheCat** - helix + Felix the cat!\n* **Mewplicate** - via a work colleague\n* **Mewover** - like \"do-over\"; inspired by the above\n\n### B-Tier\n\n* **Spliced**\n* **Carbon Copy**\n* **TheMentalist**\n* **Cable** - Cable from the X-Men has psychic powers and it could also reference the tube in the back of its head\n* **Mentok**\n* **Gene Grey**\n* **Amino**\n* **Adenine/Cytosine/Guanine/Thymine** - the four bases of DNA\n* **Master Boi**\n* **PurplWarrior** - any Scott Steiner fans in chat?\n* **Spawn** - since it's the \"child\" of Mew\n\n### C-Tier\n\n* **Mewthree** - referencing the \"Pokégod\" of old\n* **Born Again**\n* **Beeeeg Kitty**\n* **Psylocke**\n* **Professor X/Xavier**\n* **Clairvoyant**\n* **Genome**\n* **Haploid**\n* **Protein**\n* **Genera**\n* **Thicc Thighs**\n* **Leg Day**\n\n### D-Tier\n\n* **Gene Pool**\n* **Genetix**\n* **Pangaea**\n* **Sugar&Splice**\n* **Romeow** - digging deep for any kind of silly cat nicknames\n* **Mewscarada**\n* **Cogent**\n* **Sigh Kick**\n* **Chun Li**\n* **Meowgician** - from Dragon Quest; cat theme, right?\n* **Meow**\n* **Chromos**\n\nDo you have a favourite Mewtwo nickname or have a suggestion of your own?

Its eyes are also pixelated, akin to an LED display.\u003C/p>\n\t\u003C/div>\n\t\u003Cdiv class=\"room-box-right\">\n\t\t\u003Ctable class=\"room-table\" style=\"font-size:12px\">\n\t\t\t\u003Cthead>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cth>Language\u003C/th>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Cth>Name\u003C/th>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\u003C/thead>\n\t\t\t\u003Ctbody>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Japanese\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>\u003Cspan lang=\"ja\">ミライドン\u003C/span>\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>English\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Miraidon\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>French\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Miraidon\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Spanish\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Miraidon\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>German\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Miraidon\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Italian\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Miraidon\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Korean\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>\u003Cspan lang=\"ko\">미라이돈\u003C/span>\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese Chinese\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>密勒頓\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Hindi\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>मिराईडॉन\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Russian\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Мирайдон\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\t\u003Ctr>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>Thai\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003Ctd>มิไรดอน\u003C/td>\n\t\t\t\t\u003C/tr>\n\t\t\t\u003C/tbody>\n\t\t\u003C/table>\n\t\u003C/div>\n\u003C/div>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"nicknames\">Nicknames\u003C/h2>\n\u003Csection class=\"deets\">\n\t\u003Cdetails>\n\t\u003Csummary>\u003Cstrong>My nicknaming methodology\u003C/strong>\u003C/summary>\n\t\u003Cul>\n\t\t\u003Cli>I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D.

In the DLC storyline, Ogerpon was said to live with a human centuries ago in Kitakami (where the Teal Mask DLC is based). Villagers shunned them due to their strange appearances but they blended in once they were wore masks, made by a local mask-maker. In fact, the masks made them famous but three greedy Pokémon called Okidogi, Munkidori, and [Fezandipiti](/nicknames/fezandipiti/), stole them from Ogerpon in his cave and his human companion seemed to disappear in the aftermath. When Ogerpon returned, it attacked the trio and slayed them.\n\nThe villagers shunned Ogerpon once again, not knowing what had happened, and instead lionised the fallen three, naming them the \"Loyal Three\" and made a shrine for them. Ogerpon went back to its cave never to be seen my humans again (until you play the DLC of course). However, the Festival of Masks lived on and that's what drew Ogerpon out once again.\n\nThe four masks that the local mask-maker made for Ogerpon give allow it to take four different forms:\n\n* When Ogerpon wears the Teal Mask, it transforms into its Teal Mask form, which remains a pure Grass-type.\n* When Ogerpon wears the Wellspring Mask, it transforms into its Wellspring Mask form, which makes it a dual Grass/Water typing.\n* When Ogerpon wears the Hearthflame Mask, it transforms into its Hearthflame Mask form, which makes it a dual Grass/Fire typing.\n* When Ogerpon wears the Cornerstone Mask, it transforms into its Cornerstone Mask form, which makes it a dual Grass/Rock typing.\n\nIt's always worth noting that Ogerpon is always female.\n\nName-wise, Ogerpon appears to be a portmanteau of ogre + \u003Cem>-pon\u003C/em>, a Japanese suffix added to names as a \u003Cq cite=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ogerpon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Name_origin\">form of endearment\u003C/q>.\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.\n* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from.\n\nWith all that said, let's look at those Ogerpon nicknames!\n\n### S-Tier\n\n* **Baby Spice/Ginger Spice/Scary Spice/Posh Spice/Sporty Spice** - I thought these would be good for a themed team and work with different masks (I know there were 5 people in the Spice Girls and 4 masks so you can be inventive)\n* **Poncho** - a genius name I found on Reddit so full credit to [PurplePo8to](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonScarletViolet/comments/16kz4vv/comment/k0zy61w/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\n* **Polpo** - from the PS1 game, One Piece Mansion\n* **Carrie** - if you know the Stephen King book/film and Ogerpon's story, you'll get the similarities\n\n### A-Tier\n\n* **MF DOOM** - because of the masks, and just remember all caps when you spell the 'Mon name\n* **Pebbles** - as Ogerpon is a girl and I couldn't name it Bam-Bam (the Flintstones character with the club), I went with Pebbles instead\n* **Girlboss**\n* **It's So Oger**\n* **Felicia** - Shrek and Fiona's daughter\n* **Avocado**\n* **Guacamole**\n* **Salsa**\n* **Burrito**\n* **Guava**\n* **Breadfruit**\n* **Cucamelon**\n* **Soursop**\n* **Pengo**\n* **Pongo**\n* **Kabuki** - credit to [Charlie Merriman](https://www.youtube.com/@Chazingdra)\n* **Sweet Chilli**\n* **Ketchup**\n* **Harissa**\n\n### B-Tier\n\n* **Green Giant** - it's ironic because Ogerpon *isn't* a giant at all!\n* **Kate Moss** - because moss is a word associated with plants and grass types, Kate Moss is a woman, and a model so visually appealing, much like Ogerpon!\n* **Ponyo** - popular nickname, based on the titular character from Studio Ghibli movie, Ponyo\n* **Princess** - see \"Fiona\"\n* **Majora** - based on The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask\n* **Violet/Chachki** - [because of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM3rgaRtVqo)\n* **Shy Girl** - inspired by Shy Guy from the Mario universe\n* **Handsome** - because she is!\n* **Queenie** - so my mind went: King (from Tekken) > Queen > Queenie\n* **Mask Up**\n* **Lil Grn Girl**\n* **Gamora**\n* **Kiwi**\n\n### C-Tier\n\n* **Cudgey Coo** - based on its ivy cudgel and the phrase \"coochi-coochi-coo\", often said to parents to their babies because they're so cute\n* **Poison Ivy** - the ivy strikes again!\n* **Maiden** - I thought this worked since Ogerpon is a girl\n* **Chlorophyll** - chlorophyll is the green stuff that gives plants life and \"phyll\" is short for Phyllis, a woman's name\n* **PonDeReplay** - Hey Mr. DJ, won't you turn the music up?\n* **Samus** - because Samus wears a mask and she's a girl, right?\n* **Masquerade** - \u003Cq cite=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masquerade_ball\">a masquerade ball is an special kind of formal ball which many participants attend in costume wearing masks.\u003C/q>\n* **Meta** - after Meta Knight, the masked villain from the Kirby universe\n* **Olga Pond** - subtitles fail\n* **Mighty**\n* **Emerald**\n* **Chlorophyll**\n* **Mint**\n* **Seaweed**\n* **Camouflage**\n* **Meadow**\n* **Prairie**\n* **Savannah**\n* **Flick**\n* **Crackle**\n* **Brook**\n\n### D-Tier\n\n* **Fiona** - another shunned ogre?

Not sure why this is but keep that in mind!\n\n## Origins\n\nPecharunt is a small purple Pokémon that looks like a piece of mochi. In its shell, it has two ear-like protusions on the top and a small point at the bottom. There is a small black circle in the middle of its face with two white crescent-shaped markings, which look like eyes. When opened, we see the Pokémon inside which looks more like a dark purple radish. It has a long \"ponytail\" with a pink coloured end, a white band-like mark across its forehead, two blobs for eyebrows, white eyes and a bowtie-shaped mouth. And two little pink hands. You can also see the inside of the shell segments which are light pink.\n\n[According to Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pecharunt_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Game_data), Pecharunt created the Loyal Three (Okidogi, Munkidori, and [Fezandipiti](/nicknames/fezandipiti/)) and transformed them using its toxic mochi. The toxic chains are a physical representation of their forced bond. Because of all this, it has a rivalry with Ogerpon as described in the main story of the The Teal Mask DLC.\n\nName-wise, Pecharunt sounds like a combination of the Pecha Berry (itself based on a peach) and the word \"runt\". It's Japanese name also references [Momotarō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momotar%C5%8D), a Japanese folklore hero known as \"Peach Boy\".\n\n\u003C/details>\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D.
