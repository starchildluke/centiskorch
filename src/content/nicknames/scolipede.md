Scolipede was introduced in Generation 5 with a Bug/Poison typing which isn't particularly unique but there's still scope for great nicknames.

It also has a Mega form introduced in Generation 9 in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.

Let's look at some info on Scolipede and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Scolipede is basically a purple centipede with a shape that doesn't necessary scream "centipede" like our good friend, [Centiskorch](/nicknames/centiskorch/). It's bulky, stands on four legs(?), and it's a red/magenta/purple kind of colour. And apparently, Centiskorch preys on Scolipede. Uh oh!

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from.

With all that said, let's look at those Scolipede nicknames!

### A-Tier

* **Carnage**
* **Siren** - see "Bermuda" for the rationale
* **Bordeaux** - because of the wine colour
* **Merlot** - see above
* **Eclipse*

### B-Tier

* **Slithe**
* **Cholera**
* **Hot Shoes**
* **Tapdance**
* **Jabba/Jabber**

* **Fever**
* **Crimson**
* **Reaper**
* **Plum**

### C-Tier

* **Bodyodyody**
* **Crouton**
* **Britney** - because Toxic?
* **Prey**
* **Pathogen**
* **Magenta**
* **Mauve**
* **Bermuda** - I looked up the purple colour on a color app and it was called Bermuda Onion and thought, sure why not?
* **Onion**  - see above
