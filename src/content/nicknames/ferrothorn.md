Ferrothorn was introduced in Generation 5 with a Grass/Steel typing and judging by its appearance, there's a lot to use for nickname inspiration.

Let's have a look at Ferrothorn's origins and some of those nicknames.

## Origins

Ferrothorn is a durian-like Pokémon with a silver metallic body covered in thorns. It has three black horizontal stripes on its body, yellow eyes with green rims around the outside, and three long vines for appendages, each with spikes on the ends.

Name-wise, Ferrothorn is made up of the word ferrous, meaning "something containing iron", and thorn because of its thorns.

## Nicknames

I'm gonna rank these by tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.

(**Please note**: *some nicknames were suggested by GPT-3.5 Turbo, a large language model [LLM] created by OpenAI. I usually prompt it to give me two lots of lists and I prune them. Most of them don't make the cut and I'll always note if they were from an LLM. If I have used an LLM for a nickname, I will mark it with an asterisk in brackets.*)
