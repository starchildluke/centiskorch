(Note: at the original time of writing, some details about Terapagos have not been revealed. Once they have, I will amend the copy.)

Terapagos was introduced in Generation 9 with an unknown typing and two forms: Normal Form (top left image above) and Terastal Form (top right image above). Despite some unknown info, there's still plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

## Origins

Terapagos is a reptilian Pokémon, visually based on a turtle or tortoise. In its Normal Form, its body is light-blue with a crystalline shell and a green star and rings around its neck and legs. It has two light blue eyes, a diamond shape on its forehead, two diamond shapes the sides of its head, and a green diamond-shaped ponytail. Lots of diamonds!

Its Terastal Form has some variations in its appearance, with a bigger shell composed of crystals that appear to have multiple types on each shell section, and a wide flourising tail similar in shape to Ninetales but shorter. This "fur" is also present in the front part of its body.

Although not confirmed, its origins come from a combination of:

* the Galápagos green turtle or Galápagos tortoise
* the mythical World Turtle
* the Japanese minogame
* the diamondback terrapin

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Terapagos nicknames!

### S-Tier

* **Gamera** - based on the kaiju, Gamera
* **Turtlellini** - Terapagos has no connection to pasta but how cute is that name?

### A-Tier

* **Pax** - so GPT-3.5 suggested "Carapax" (which happens to be a DC supervillain) but I didn't think it quite fit so I shortened it to Pax.

### B-Tier

* **Gemma/Gem** - Because of the gem theme?
* **Shellz** - deadass!
* **Topaz** - it's a blue gemstone after all
* **Torope** - the Algonquian word for "terrapin"
* **Logo** - [if you know, you know](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language))
* **Hockey/puck** - because it's a giant hockey puck!
* **Hypno-Disc** - named after the runner-up of Robot Wars Series 1
* **Jade** - apparently, my colour picker app said the greenish colour of Terapagos's shell is called Jolly Jade
* **Cruz** - Santa Cruz is one of the cantons of the Galápagos Islands and it's a homophone of "cruise"
* **Mydas** - from Chelonia mydas, the Latin name for the green sea turtle
* **Gala** - from Galápagos
* **Testudo** - the mascot of the University of Maryland, College Park

### C-Tier

* **Baena** - the name of a prehistoric turtle
* **Karma** - apparently, my colour picker app said the deep purpley blue colour of Terapagos's skin is called Good Karma
* **Pacific** - the Galápagos Islands are in the Pacific Ocean so it seems fitting
* **Turtleneck**
* **Terrorpin** - from [the Legend of Zelda](/nicknames/themes/legend-of-zelda/)

### D-Tier

* **Crystle** - kinda like Squirtle? Sorry, I phoned this one in
