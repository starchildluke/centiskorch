Hydrapple was introduced in Generation 9 with a Grass/Dragon typing as the evolved form of Dipplin so there's lots of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's have a look at Hydrapple's origins and some of those nicknames.

## Origins

Hydrapple is a Pokémon comprised of an red apple with 7 green dragons—or "syrpents"—living inside. It looks very similar to Dipplin and evolves when Dipplin knows Dragon Cheer.

Name-wise, Hydrapple appears to be a portmanteau of hydra (a serpentine monster from Greek and Roman mythology) + apple.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Hydrapple nicknames!
