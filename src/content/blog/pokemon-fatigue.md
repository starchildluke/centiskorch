I've been playing Pokémon since 1998 and I've enjoyed every minute of the experience. But I'm currently bored of the recent games and constantly find myself going back to older ones to maintain the enjoyment.

I want to be clear: I did enjoy Scarlet and Violet when they came out and completed the games within a week or so and got into shiny hunting and VGC. But after just under a year and a DLC, I'm just... tired. The games don't have much to them after you've done everything and because of my personal experiences with shiny hunting (note: I've been incredibly lucky with my shinies), I've exhausted that element of the game. I'm very grateful for that and don't take it for granted but I also don't feel like it's worth forcing further gameplay when I'm not enjoying it. Shiny hunting shouldn't be a chore, and neither should VGC or merely exploring an environment with constant lag.

So where does that leave me? Well, I'm taking a break from SV until the new DLC drops (whenever that is). Because of all the new Pokémon it'll have, the storyline, the ability to get starters, and lots of new moves and legendaries, it'll negate everything I've written here. Or my current feelings will return in about a year's time once I've rinsed out the second DLC. I'm starting to feel that with Pokémon games more as time goes on. But luckily there are 8 other generations in this franchise so my boredom never lasts long.

Until then, I'll find something to do. If you've experienced something similar, [email me](mailto:me@centiskor.ch) and let me know.
