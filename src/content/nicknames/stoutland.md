Stoutland was introduced in Generation 5 with a Normal typing so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Stoutland and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Stoutland is a dog Pokémon known for rescuing people in mountains or at sea (like a St. Bernard). It has a brown furred head with cream fur on its forehead and a long moustache coming from under and around its black nose. Its bottom half is a blueish-grey and it has four brown paws with blue paw pads.

Stoutland is the epitome of a good doggo as it is very helpful, intelligent and loyal, and is <q cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Stoutland_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Pok.C3.A9dex_entries_2">immensely proud of its impressive moustache</q>. In terms of its name origins, it like comes from the word "stout", meaning bulky, in reference of its body, and Newfoundland which is a breed of dog which Stoutland shares its traits with.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from.
