Golden Sun is an RPG series published by Nintendo. While Golden Sun and Pokémon aren't as closely linked as other games, they both share general RPG traits such as emphases on elemental powers, both games being turn-based, move effectiveness (super, neutral, or not very effective), and awesome moves that do big damage. It's often seen as one of the best RPGs of all time and as a completely biased Golden Sun fan myself, I agree.

## Nicknames

My methodology for picking Golden Sun themed nicknames is as follows:

* I will list some games from the franchise and note down characters from each
* I will then assign Pokémon I think would match well with those characters
* It might be that some characters lend themselves well to more than one Pokémon, particular if they're based on regular animals such as fish or horses
* I will only mention fully evolved Pokémon (if they evolve) but if you don't plan to evolve the Pokémon in question, the name should still fit
