Yanma was introduced in Generation 2 with a Bug/Flying typing and evolves into Yanmega when leveled up while knowing the move Ancient Power.

Let's have a look at Yanma's origins and some of those nicknames.

## Origins

Yanma is a red dragonfly-like Pokémon with a green head, four white wings with a single orange stripe on each one, and six legs. Its tail has two flat extensions on either side, similar to a helicopter or light aircraft (more on that comparison in the next paragraph).

It appears to be based on a dragonfly but I definitely see elements of helicopters in its design. Name-wise, Yanma comes from the word "yanma" (<span lang="zh">蜻蜓</span>) meaning "large dragonfly". Nuff said!

## Nicknames

I'm gonna rank these by tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.

(**Please note**: *some nicknames were suggested by GPT-3.5 Turbo, a large language model [LLM] created by OpenAI. I usually prompt it to give me two lots of lists and I prune them. Most of them don't make the cut and I'll always note if they were from an LLM. If I have used an LLM for a nickname, I will mark it with an asterisk in brackets.*)

### S-Tier

* **Airwolf** - as it reminds me of the helicopter from Airwolf

* **Motif** - as dragonflies were often used as motifs in Art Nouveau
* **Pepper** - from a haiku by Japanese poet Matsuo Bashō: <q cite="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=C6g_0ibafjcC&pg=PA36&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false">Crimson pepper pod / add two pairs of wings, and look / darting dragonfly</q>
