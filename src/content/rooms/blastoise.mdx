Blastoise is a Pokémon introduced in Pokémon Blue in 1996. It is the game mascot and appears on the front cover.

<h2 class="headings">Description</h2>

Blastoise is a big blue turtle/tortoise Pokémon and it happens to me my favourite. It's the final evolution of Squirtle, my favourite starter and probably the most popular of all Kanto starters (at least).

Being bipedal, Blastoise mainly stand on its two legs but is known to go on all-fours (as seen in its Pokémon Silver sprite). In terms of its shiny, Blastoise turns lilac and its shell goes from brown to green. Personally, I'm not a fan of the skin colour change as I love the blue (and it doesn't fit with the blue of Squirtle's shiny which is a lighter hue) but I love the green shell a lot.

Blastoise also has two other forms: a Mega form (Mega Blastoise), and a Gigantamax form (Gigantamax Blastoise).

Mega Blastoise (left) has two extra shells over its arms, housing their own water cannons (one per arm). It now only has one water cannon on its bag but it's much larger and its shape is similar to a silencer. Mega Blastoise's face is also different, with more pointed ears and a pointed chin.

Gigantamax Blastoise is much larger due to the Gigantamax effect and it has white eyes with bright blue sclerae. Its underbelly is now dark red and its body is a lighter blue. Its shell now has an array of 31 water cannons of different sizes. Its skin has white triangular spots on the tail and legs, reminscent of the markings on the Cloned Blastoise from Pokémon: The First Movie.

Blastoise is best known for its powerful extendable cannons, which reside in its shell and can pierce steel and concrete so you don't want to stand to close to one in midstream! Most of its Pokédex entries reference the cannons and what they can do, such as Emerald:

> The waterspouts that protrude from its shell are highly accurate. Their bullets of water can precisely nail tin cans from a distance of over 160 feet.

As of Gen 9, it can learn moves from 10 different types, with a near even ratio between Special and Physical attacks. However, its offensive stats aren't the best compared to its defensive stats despite most Blastoise in competitive battling used for offence.

<h2 class="headings">Why I love Blastoise</h2>

<div class="float-right-img"><img src="/images/blastoise-first-movie-250px.jpeg" alt="Mega Blastoise" width="125px" loading="lazy"/></div>

I recently found out that my mum picked Pokémon Blue as my first Pokémon game because she liked the colour and I ADORED Blastoise on that box art. That meant I HAD to choose Squirtle as my starter and I do 99% of the time when I replay games starting in Kanto! I already loved tortoises (one of my favourite animals) so seeing one in one of my favourite colours with cool water cannons on its back, it was a dream to witness.

In Scarlet and Violet, I have a shiny Blastoise called SprayCharles (taken from my [Blastoise nickname page](/nicknames/blastoise/)) with a defensive build and I love him so much! The Gen 9 overworld animation is awesome too as Blastoise sprays its cannons as it swims, perfect for auto-battling in bodies of water. He's also a beefy boy so there's no chance of getting destroyed without a lot of offensive build-up!
