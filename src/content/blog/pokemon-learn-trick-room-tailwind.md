Sometimes you want Tailwind for speed control and sometimes you want Trick Room. But what if you wanted both and didn't have space for two separate Pokémon for each one? Well, you could have the best of both worlds because there are 13 Pokémon (at the time of writing) that can learn both Tailwind and Trick Room.

I've listed them below and will update it with levels and methods of learning both moves when I get a chance.

* Arceus
* Lunala
* Mew
* Comfey
* Siglyph
* Whimsicott
* Natu/Xatu
* Woobat/Swoobat
* Galarian Articuno
* Drifloon/Drifblim
