Raging Bolt was introduced in Generation 9 with a Electric/Dragon typing based on Raikou so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Raging Bolt and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Raging Bolt is a dinosaur-like, hybrid Pokémon with feline features (particularly the sabre-toothed cat) that measures 5.2m in height and weighs 480.0kg. It has a yellow coat, like Raikou, with black stripes all over its body, a white underbelly that runs up its neck, and a blue zig-zag tail. Where it differs from Raikou is its long neck with a cloud-like ruff around at the top, just under the head.

Raging Bolt is said to be an ancient Pokémon that is related to Raikou but also could be an ancient _version_ of Raikou from an alternate timeline. We still don't know which is true.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Raging Bolt nicknames!
