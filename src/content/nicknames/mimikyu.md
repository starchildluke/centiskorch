Mimikyu was introduced in Generation 7 with a Ghost/Fairy dual typing so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Mimikyu and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Mimikyu is a small Pokémon whose body is completely covered with an old rag with eye holes. However, this isn't just any old rag—the rag is shaped and styled to look like Pikachu (including a brown stick at the back acting as the tail). It's unknown what Mimikyu looks like under there but we do know it has long, black claw-like appendages that come out from under the rag to attack.

It's said that its eyes glow yellow when irritated. When the rag (or disguise) is damaged, the head flops and it becomes more vulnerable to attacks.

Etymologically, Mimikyu is wordplay for "mimic you", referencing its copying of Pikachu.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from.
