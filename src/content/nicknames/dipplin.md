Dipplin was introduced in Generation 9 with a Grass/Dragon typing as the evolved form of Applin so there's lots of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's have a look at Dipplin's origins and some of those nicknames.

**Please note**: at the time of writing, this may contain spoilers for the DLC but nothing connected to the storyline.

## Origins

Dipplin is a green worm-like Pokémon who lives inside a red apple. It looks very similar to Applin except that Dipplin's apple is dripping with red syrup thanks to the Syrupy Apple you need from Kitakami to evolve it. Interestingly, Dipplin appears to be made up of two bodies - one with the head (the fore-wyrm) that pokes out of the top, and one with the tail (the core-wyrm) that pokes out of the back.

Notably, Dipplin's shiny form is gold and its signature move Syrup Bomb also changes colour, from red to gold. To my knowledge, this is the first time a move has changed colour based on its shiny.

Name-wise, Dipplin appears to be a portmanteau of dip + Applin. [According to Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dipplin_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Name_origin), its Japanese name "Kamicchu" may be <q cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dipplin_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Name_origin">a combination of 果 ka (fruit), 花蜜 kamitsu (nectar), 虫 chū (bug; worm), and カジッチュ Kajicchu (Applin).</q>

## Nicknames

y methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Dipplin nicknames!
