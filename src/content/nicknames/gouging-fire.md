Gouging Fire was introduced in Generation 9 with a Fire/Dragon typing based on Entei so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Gouging Fire and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Gouging Fire is a dinosaur-like, hybrid Pokémon with both canine and feline features. It has brown fur, like Entei, with three green spike lines on its back legs, cream fur on its chest, and five grey spikes on its back. There are black cuffs around its ankles and it has a predominately yellow crest on its head, with green and red in the centre. Honestly, look up Entei and just add more colour, fur, and prehistoric features.

Gouging Fire is said to be an ancient Pokémon that is related to Entei but also could be an ancient _version_ of Entei from an alternate timeline. We still don't know which is true.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

Please note: all nicknames could easily work for Entei as well!
