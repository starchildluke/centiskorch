The Legend of Zelda is an action-adventure franchise published by Nintendo. Because of its proximity to Pokémon both in certain stylistic features and both helping Nintendo assert its dominance in the video games market, it makes sense to look at the franchise for some nickname inspiration.

## Nicknames

My methodology for picking Legend of Zelda themed nicknames is as follows:

* I will list some games from the franchise and note down characters from each
* I will then assign Pokémon I think would match well with those characters
* It might be that some characters lend themselves well to more than one Pokémon, particular if they're based on regular animals such as fish or horses
* I will only mention fully evolved Pokémon (if they evolve) but if you don't plan to evolve the Pokémon in question, the name should still fit
