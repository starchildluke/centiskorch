Kingdra was introduced in Generation 2 with a Water/Dragon typing as the evolved form of Seadra so there's lots of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Kingdra and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Kingdra is a seahorse-like Pokémon with blue scales all over its body and yellow scales on its belly. It also has a white fin on its back, supported by blue spines.

As its name and evolution line suggests, Kingdra takes inspiration from the seahorse and the weedy seadragon, which is related to seahorses.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from
