Centiskorch was introduced in Generation 8 with a Bug/Fire typing and a Gigantamax form so there's plenty of inspiration for a nickname.

Let's look at some info on Centiskorch and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

When you look at Centiskorch, you see two things: a centipede and fire and luckily, the fire centipede (Orphnaeus brevilabiatus) is a real insect. Its design is also based on radiator coils. But what's really interesting is the Japanese myth of the Ōmukade:

<blockquote>
	<p>The Ōmukade is a giant man-eating centipede that lives in the mountains. While it eats humans, the Ōmukade has a weakness to human saliva. It also preys on great serpents and dragons.</p>
	<cite>via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cmukade">Wikipedia</a></cite>
</blockquote>

As for its name, it's a portmanteau of "**centi**pede" and "**skorch**".

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Centiskorch nicknames!

### S-Tier

* **Flare Jordan** - Ooh, I like that one! Based on Air Jordan if you didn't know
* **Forge** - you can't forge without fire!
* **Crossfire** - There's a cross on its mouth and, you know, fire.
* **Hector** - "Hecto-" is Greek for 100. Centi- is Latin for 100. And I read this nickname in Gus Fring's voice which makes it funnier.
* **Box Box** - My son called his Sizzlipede this and the random cuteness makes it an Ubers pick by default. Not sorry, I DO make the rules around here!
* **Ricochet**

### A-Tier

* **Firecracker** - The one I used for my Centiskorch. It felt fitting given it's G-Max form.
* **Mustang** - FullMetal Alchemist fans should recognised this name with the click of a finger
* **Paprika** - it's a red pepper spice, nuff said!
* **Cayenne** - hot stuff coming through!
* **Queen Pede** - based on the character from the Atari classic, Centipede

* **Garet** - If you're a Golden Sun fan, you may remember Garet as the Fire Adept
* **Borlotto** - The borlotti bean has a cultivar called Borlotto Lingua di Fuoco or "Tongue of Fire". You can work the rest out
* **Kindle** - v. set (something) on fire.
* **Rebbie** - [Rebbie Jackson's hit song was Centipede](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8SdzwoIcwo)!
* **Smaug** - the fire breathing dragon from Lord of the Rings
* **Pepper** - it's a real name and a hot one too!
* **Heartburn** - not a comfortable feeling, let me tell ya!
* **Cacus** - Cacus was the fire-breathing son of Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. And he was a giant!
* **Vulcan**
* **Dhalsim** - he can breathe fire, apparently
* **Crimson** - shade of red
* **Wildfire** - some centipedes live in forests and I could see a Centiskorch living up to this name
* **FastFootFred** - Another language model suggestion. It's so out there and I kinda love it.

* **Atari** - see "Queen Pede" above

### C-Tier

* **Pesto** - pesto can be red... that's all I've got and now I'm hungry
* **Chargrilled** - You could probably grill burgers on a Centiskorch. I wouldn't though.
* **Spain** - They have a red flag but the main inspiration came from Sir Francis Drake who was said to have "figuratively 'singed the King of Spain's beard' when he raided Cadiz and burnt the Spanish fleet." I could see Centiskorch doing that.

* **Blacklist** - Fire burns and turns things black. Sorry, still thinking about Burn Notice

* **Predator**
* **ScotchBonnet**
* **Pagoda**
* **Merlot**
* **Stove**
* **Toaster**
* **Salsa**

### D-Tier

* **Radiator** - A bit reductive perhaps but it was based on a radiator, so...
* **FrancisDrake** - see "Spain"
* **Glowworm** - I know it's not a worm but it does glow
* **Fentyskorch** - would you put makeup on a flaming centipede?
* **Turmeric**
* **Cinnamon**
* **Forgefiend**
* **Skewer**
