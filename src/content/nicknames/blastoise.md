Blastoise was introduced in Generation 1 with a Water typing and a Gigantamax form so there's plenty of inspiration for a nickname.

With that said, here are some facts about Blastoise and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Blastoise is a giant turtle with water cannons on its back. And half of its name is tortoise. And blast. While it's the final evolution of Squirtle, it may have been a standalone Pokémon with no connection to Squirtle or Wartotle.  

There was early concept art for a Pokémon called "Karabajio" which looked a helluva lot like Blastoise but without the water cannons (or maybe they were tucked in, we'll never know). The name looked like a play on Caravaggio as an homage to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles using famous Renassiance artists for their names.

(**Please note**: *some nicknames were suggested by GPT-3.5 Turbo, a large language model [LLM] created by OpenAI. I usually prompt it to give me two lots of lists and I prune them. Most of them don't make the cut and I'll always note if they were from an LLM.*)
