Dipplin was introduced in Generation 9 with a Grass/Dragon typing as the evolved form of Applin so there's lots of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's have a look at Dipplin's origins and some of those nicknames.

**Please note**: at the time of writing, this may contain spoilers for the DLC but nothing connected to the storyline.

## Origins

Dipplin is a green worm-like Pokémon who lives inside a red apple. It looks very similar to Applin except that Dipplin's apple is dripping with red syrup thanks to the Syrupy Apple you need from Kitakami to evolve it. Interestingly, Dipplin appears to be made up of two bodies - one with the head (the fore-wyrm) that pokes out of the top, and one with the tail (the core-wyrm) that pokes out of the back.

Notably, Dipplin's shiny form is gold and its signature move Syrup Bomb also changes colour, from red to gold. To my knowledge, this is the first time a move has changed colour based on its shiny.

Name-wise, Dipplin appears to be a portmanteau of dip + Applin. [According to Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dipplin_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Name_origin), its Japanese name "Kamicchu" may be <q cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dipplin_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Name_origin">a combination of 果 ka (fruit), 花蜜 kamitsu (nectar), 虫 chū (bug; worm), and カジッチュ Kajicchu (Applin).</q>

## Nicknames

I'm gonna rank these in Smogon tiers: Ubers, OU, UU, RU, NU. Ubers are my favourite/best and NU was me phoning it in.

(**Please note**: *some nicknames were suggested by GPT-3.5 Turbo, a large language model [LLM] created by OpenAI. I usually prompt it to give me two lots of lists and I prune them. Most of them don't make the cut and I'll always note if they were from an LLM. If I have used an LLM for a nickname, I will mark it with an asterisk in brackets.*)
