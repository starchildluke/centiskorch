Centiskorch was introduced in Generation 8 with a Bug/Fire typing and a Gigantamax form so there's plenty of inspiration for a nickname.

With that said, here are some facts about Centiskorch and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

When you look at Centiskorch, you see two things: a centipede and fire and luckily, the fire centipede (Orphnaeus brevilabiatus) is a real insect. Its design is also based on radiator coils. But what's really interesting is the Japanese myth of the Ōmukade:

<blockquote>
	<p>The Ōmukade is a giant man-eating centipede that lives in the mountains. While it eats humans, the Ōmukade has a weakness to human saliva. It also preys on great serpents and dragons.</p>
	<cite>via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cmukade">Wikipedia</a></cite>
</blockquote>

As for its name, it's a portmanteau of "**centi**pede" and "**skorch**".

(**Please note**: *some nicknames were suggested by GPT-3.5 Turbo, a large language model [LLM] created by OpenAI. I usually prompt it to give me two lots of lists and I prune them. Most of them don't make the cut and I'll always note if they were from an LLM.*)

## Nicknames

I'm gonna rank these in Smogon tiers: Ubers, OU, UU, RU, NU. Ubers are my favourite/best and NU was me phoning it in.

### Ubers

* **Flare Jordan** - Ooh, I like that one! Based on Air Jordan if you didn't know
* **Forge** - you can't forge without fire!
* **Crossfire** - There's a cross on its mouth and, you know, fire.
* **Hector** - "Hecto-" is Greek for 100. Centi- is Latin for 100. And I read this nickname in Gus Fring's voice which makes it funnier.
* **Box Box** - My son called his Sizzlipede this and the random cuteness makes it an Ubers pick by default. Not sorry, I DO make the rules around here!

### OU

* **Firecracker** - The one I used for my Centiskorch. It felt fitting given it's G-Max form.
* **Mustang** - FullMetal Alchemist fans should recognised this name with the click of a finger
* **Paprika** - it's a red pepper spice, nuff said!
* **Cayenne** - hot stuff coming through!
* **Queen Pede** - based on the character from the Atari classic, Centipede
* **Soot** - based on the Alpha Centipede from Nintendo game, Centipede: Infestation
* **Scoot** - I dunno, it just fits.

### UU

* **Flameboy** - [Thank Phoebe from Friends for that idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7o7By0FlDU)
* **Mushu** - A common nickname idea, based on the Chinese dragon from the movie Mulan
* **Garet** - If you're a Golden Sun fan, you may remember Garet as the Fire Adept
* **Borlotto** - The borlotti bean has a cultivar called Borlotto Lingua di Fuoco or "Tongue of Fire". You can work the rest out
* **Kindle** - v. set (something) on fire.
* **Rebbie** - [Rebbie Jackson's hit song was Centipede](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a8SdzwoIcwo)!
* **Smaug** - the fire breathing dragon from Lord of the Rings
* **Pepper** - it's a real name and a hot one too!
* **Heartburn** - not a comfortable feeling, let me tell ya!
* **Cacus** - Cacus was the fire-breathing son of Vulcan, the Roman god of fire. And he was a giant!
* **Dhalsim** - he can breathe fire, apparently
* **Crimson** - shade of red
* **Wildfire** - some centipedes live in forests and I could see a Centiskorch living up to this name
* **FastFootFred** - Another language model suggestion. It's so out there and I kinda love it.
* **Millie** - not a millipede. Not a millipede!!!
* **Atari** - see "Queen Pede" above

### RU

* **Pesto** - pesto can be red... that's all I've got and now I'm hungry
* **Chargrilled** - You could probably grill burgers on a Centiskorch. I wouldn't though.
* **Spain** - They have a red flag but the main inspiration came from Sir Francis Drake who was said to have "figuratively 'singed the King of Spain's beard' when he raided Cadiz and burnt the Spanish fleet." I could see Centiskorch doing that.
* **Burn Notice** - I just love the show lol
* **Blacklist** - Fire burns and turns things black. Sorry, still thinking about Burn Notice
* **Fuego** - Spanish for fire
* **Corona** - not the virus
* **Inferno** - It's G-Max move is Centiferno. Maybe a little on the nose? I'll leave that up to you.

### NU

* **Radiator** - A bit reductive perhaps but it was based on a radiator, so...
* **FrancisDrake** - see "Spain"
* **Glowworm** - I know it's not a worm but it does glow
* **Crawlzilla** - GPT-3.5 Turbo suggested this and it's so cheesy that I kept it in
* **Fentyskorch** - would you put makeup on a flaming centipede?
