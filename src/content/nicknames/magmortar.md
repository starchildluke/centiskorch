Magmortar was introduced in Generation 4 with a pure Fire typing and, more importantly, as the evolved form of Magmar so there's lots of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's have a look at Magmortar's origins and some of those nickname ideas!

## Origins

Magmortar is a human-shaped(?), Pokémon with an egg-shaped torso and red-and-yellow flamed stripes across it. It has pink lips and differs from Magmar with its almost clown-like flaming "hair" coming out of the top and sides of its head. Another notable difference is the cannons that come out of its arms (Armarouge has a similar design but its cannon comes from its armour when both hands are combined).

Like Magby and Magmar, Magmortar takes inspiration from the booby (a seabird) and ducks. It may also be inspired by the karura, a divine Japanese mythological creature which has a human body and birdlike head and is said to breath fire.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Magmortar nicknames!

### S-Tier

* **Apokolips** - okay, so hear me out. When I was a kid, I thought Apocalypse in the X-Men animated series was called that because of his lips (ApocaLIPS). Then I find out years later that there's a planet called Apokolips and get confused. And now it's 2023 and I think Apokolips is a great name because of Magmortar's lips. The end.
* **Garet** - after Garet from Golden Sun. Automatically S-Tier because I named my Magmortar "Garet" in my [Black 2/White 2 playthrough](/logs/my-pokemon-teams/)

### A-Tier

* **Gauge** - a gun pun
* **Fuze** - a device that ignites the charge of a cannon's projectile
* **Oppenheimer** - too soon?
* **Krusty** - because, look at it!
* **Backfire**
* **Stromboli** - a volcano in Italy. Also a tasty baked good!
* **Caldera** - <q cite="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/calderas/">a large depression formed when a volcano erupts and collapses.</q>
* **Tephra**
* **Rouge**
* **Roja**
* **BurnieCindrs**

### B-Tier

* **Flame Boy** - [shout out to Phoebe Buffay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7o7By0FlDU)
* **Sula** - from the genus Sula, of which the booby is a member of
* **Diesel** - because flamable and dangerous!
* **Torch**
* **Mars**
* **Aries**
* **Kōjin** - a Japanese god of fire

* **Trebuchet**

* **Flare Jordan**

### C-Tier

* **Nick Cannon** - because cannons

* **Pyroclast**
* **Hades**
* **Two Cannons**
