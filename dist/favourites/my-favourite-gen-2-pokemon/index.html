	<p>Here is a list of my favourite Generation 2 Pokémon, with their sprites from Gold/Silver/Crystal (w/o animations I’m afraid), and why I love them so much.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Pokémon</th><th>Sprite</th><th>Reason</th></tr></thead><tr><td>Totodile</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/158.png" alt="a sprite of Totodile" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>I have to start with my fave starter from Gen 2 and my partner&#39;s all-time fave. There&#39;s no gun at my head, I genuinely love this little croc. It&#39;s cheeky and always down to fight. And great for speedruns thanks to Rage mechanics.</td></tr><tr><td>Feraligatr</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/160.png" alt="a sprite of Feraligatr" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>I&#39;ve broken tradition here by adding two Pokémon from the same line but I wanted to emphasise the fact that I love Feraligatr too. It&#39;s a big alligator and probably one of the more forgotten final evolutions in Pokémon, and especially in Gen 2. Meganium is a big green dinosaur and played a major role in New Pokémon Snap and Typhlosion got a new regional variant in Legends: Arceus. Feraligatr has nothing so far. It&#39;s a shame but I love it all the same.</td></tr><tr><td>Sentret</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/161.png" alt="a sprite of Sentret" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>Sentret was the first Pokémon I ever encountered in Johto. I was 10, living in Atlanta, and visited Toys &#39;R Us for the first time. There was a Game Boy Color on display with Pokémon Gold and I played it for a few minutes. It was the best thing ever and Sentret was adorable. I don&#39;t catch many in my playthroughs but maybe I will and actually use one. Unevolved. For the culture.</td></tr><tr><td>Ariados</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/168.png" alt="a sprite of Ariados" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>Bug types generally suck competitively but this isn&#39;t a VGC popularity contest (because Ariados certainly wouldn&#39;t in that). But I love its name and its gorgeous sprite.</td></tr><tr><td>Crobat</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/169.png" alt="a sprite of Crobat" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>I&#39;m not a fan of Zubat or Golbat. But Crobat? Now that&#39;s good work. Not a huge fan of the sprite (later gens did it justice) but this Pokémon was awesome and super fast. I&#39;ve yet to keep a Zubat alive long enough in a Nuzlocke to get it this far though. Maybe one day.</td></tr><tr><td>Xatu</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/178.png" alt="a sprite of Xatu" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>I always found Xatu so serene and I loved its Native American roots. Its based on the resplendent quetzal and features &#39;ancient art of Sun Gazing, a form of spiritual meditation practiced by the Aztec and Mayan peoples in the belief that it would give them supernatural power&#39;, according to Wikipedia. And its name derives from &#39;xat&#39;, a Native American carved pole. Love that attention to detail.</td></tr><tr><td>Ampharos</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/181.png" alt="a sprite of Ampharos" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>The PokéGod we knew as Denryu, thought to be a pre-evolution [citation needed] of Dragonite, was a strange creature. Its previous stages were both sheep but this is Pokémon where things don&#39;t make sense as praxis. But it was a default pick for anyone who wanted an Electric type early in the game. 115 Special Attack and decent bulk made this electric dragon a beast.</td></tr><tr><td>Politoed</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/186.png" alt="a sprite of Politoed" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>A new evolution that I never got the chance to own because I didn&#39;t have a friend to trade with (story of my life). It&#39;s a big green frog and it always looks happy, what&#39;s not to love here? It has 500 base stats and it could pack a fair punch and take a few. I should know—I loved using Politoed in SwSh VGC.</td></tr><tr><td>Sunflora</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/192.png" alt="a sprite of Sunflora" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>I&#39;m gonna cheat a little here and say I didn&#39;t fall in love with Sunflora until I used it in a Black and White playthrough. What I didn&#39;t know is how strong it was. Yeah, it&#39;s frail but 105 Special Attack? And 85 Special Defense isn&#39;t anything to sniff at in Gen 2. I should have used this thing more often. And I think I will in future.</td></tr><tr><td>Wooper</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/194.png" alt="a sprite of Wooper" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>The cutest little axolotl in the world. Just happy to exist. No thoughts, just pleasant vibes. We need more of that in this world.</td></tr><tr><td>Umbreon</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/197.png" alt="a sprite of Umbreon" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>I adore Umbreon. It reminds me of my old cat, a British/Blue cross and a cheeky little thing. Bulky as heck, a Dark type, and an all-round adorable Pokémon. And the shiny is *chef&#39;s kiss*.</td></tr><tr><td>Misdreavus</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/200.png" alt="a sprite of Misdreavus" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>It&#39;s wild that you can&#39;t access this Pokémon, a new Johto Pokémon and the first pure Ghost type, until the end of the game. That means unless someone trades with you, you&#39;re not gonna fit this into your team without dropping something and grinding for days. But it&#39;s a cutey with a pearl necklack. I feel like they were making amends for Jynx and the Blackface stuff in terms of feminine Ghost types.</td></tr><tr><td>Forretress</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/205.png" alt="a sprite of Forretress" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>The main reason this bagworm is here is because of its shiny which is my all-time favourite. But aside from that, I like that it&#39;s a giant steel orb that explodes and throws spikes around. It choose violence every day and I respect that. You know what you&#39;re getting with Forretress.</td></tr><tr><td>Dunsparce</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/206.png" alt="a sprite of Dunsparce" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>Take the bus! (IYKYK) This thing is a tank and I&#39;m so glad it got an evolution. But before that, we have a Normal type land snake with a beard. It&#39;s such a Japanese design and I love it. This thing can Headbutt and Glare you to glory if you give it a chance.</td></tr><tr><td>Scizor</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/212.png" alt="a sprite of Scizor" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>They gave Scyther an incredible evolution in Scizor. A red Mech with chomping claws? Gimme gimme gimme!</td></tr><tr><td>Sneasel</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/215.png" alt="a sprite of Sneasel" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>A Dark/Ice weasel is exactly the kind of thing I&#39;d expect from Game Freak in what was supposed to be the last Pokémon generation. My primary experience with Sneasel was facing my rival&#39;s and while it never posed a threat (4x weakness to Fighting and plenty of other 2x weaknesses), I liked the design choice.</td></tr><tr><td>Ursaring</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/217.png" alt="a sprite of Ursaring" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>This bear looks angry that you&#39;ve woken it up from hibernation and it&#39;s gonna let you know that it&#39;s not happy.</td></tr><tr><td>Octillery</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/224.png" alt="a sprite of Octillery" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>Octillery is one of the weirdest and most wonderful Pokémon Game Freak has ever created. It&#39;s movepool is remarkable for its type coverage, which only gets wilder through the gens. And it got an signature move in Octazooka which had 65 base power and had a 50% chance to lower the target&#39;s accuracy by one stage. Even the name is awesome (in Japanese, it&#39;s Okutank Cannon, where Okutank is Octillery&#39;s Japanese name).</td></tr><tr><td>Skarmory</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/227.png" alt="a sprite of Skarmory" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>Skarmory flapped so Corviknight could soar. It was part of the iconic SkarmBliss dueo in competitive battling and took one helluva beating. Great inclusion to the Steel type.</td></tr><tr><td>Houndoom</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/229.png" alt="a sprite of Houndoom" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>A hound from Hell. With horns. Need I say more? It was the Pokémon of choice for the higher-ups in Team Rocket and for good reason. I lost a Pokémon in a Nuzlocke to one of these things. Dark/Fire was a great dual typing for the aesthetic.</td></tr><tr><td>Donphan</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/232.png" alt="a sprite of Donphan" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>Fans will remember seeing Donphan revealed in the First Movie as Ash challenged a trainer in the intro. A rolling elephant that was a Rock type? That&#39;s right up my street.</td></tr><tr><td>Porygon2</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/233.png" alt="a sprite of Porygon2" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>Lemme upgrade ya but in Pokémon form. They literally smoothed out the rough edges of Porygon and I can&#39;t help but feel that this was a metaphor for its predecessor&#39;s controversies. A great Pokémon and a great upgrade to the digital duck.</td></tr><tr><td>Entei</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/244.png" alt="a sprite of Entei" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>Is that you, Dad? (IYKYK) But seriously, a majestic looking Pokémon based on a lion (we&#39;d eventually get a proper fire lion in the form of Litleo and Pyroar).</td></tr><tr><td>Suicune</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/245.png" alt="a sprite of Suicune" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>Is that you, Sis? (Nothing to &#39;know&#39; here; it&#39;s just that Suicune&#39;s hair reminds me of my sister&#39;s.) But seriously, another majestic looking Pokémon based on a leopard (we&#39;d eventually get a proper leopard Pokémon in the form of Liepard).</td></tr><tr><td>Lugia</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/249.png" alt="a sprite of Lugia" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>Is that you, Mum? (look up Lugia&#39;s sad origin story on YouTube to get the idea.) But seriously, yet another majestic looking Pokémon based on a plesiosaur and possibly Ryūjin, a Japanese dragon god of the sea that lived on the ocean floor.</td></tr><tr><td>Ho-Oh</td><td><img src="/images/sprites/gen2/250.png" alt="a sprite of Ho-Oh" width="56px" height="56px"/></td><td>Is that you, Uncle? (I dunno, just got an uncle vibe from it.) But seriously, a majestic looking Pokémon once again, based on a Chinese phoenix. That rainbow plumage!</td></tr></table>
