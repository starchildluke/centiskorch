Robin Hood is an outlaw who "stole from the rich and gave to the poor". Born in Doncaster in the United Kingdom, he is synonymous with Sherwood Forest in Nottinghamshire and fighting with the Sheriff of Nottingham.

While there aren't many strong links between Robin Hood and Pokémon, it's heavily character-based and that lends itself to creative nicknames with all the different traits on offer.

## Nicknames

My methodology for picking Robin Hood themed nicknames is as follows:

* I will use characters and story themes from all Robin Hood media (including the Disney movie)
* I will then assign Pokémon I think would match well with those characters
* It might be that some characters lend themselves well to more than one Pokémon, particular if they're based on regular animals such as fish or horses
* I will only mention fully evolved Pokémon (if they evolve) but if you don't plan to evolve the Pokémon in question, the name should still fit
