Kingdra was introduced in Generation 2 with a Water/Dragon typing as the evolved form of Seadra so there's lots of inspiration for nicknames.

With that said, here are some info about Kingdra and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Kingdra is a seahorse-like Pokémon with blue scales all over its body and yellow scales on its belly. It also has a white fin on its back, supported by blue spines.

As its name and evolution line suggests, Kingdra takes inspiration from the seahorse and the weedy seadragon, which is related to seahorses.
