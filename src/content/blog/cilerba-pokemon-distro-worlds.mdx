[Cilerba](https://github.com/cilerba) made an incredible system that allowed trainers to get old Pokémon distributions from the 2000s and took it to the Pokémon World Championships in August for his friends and other attendees to try.

For those who don't know, there were [distribution machines in New York City](https://pokemoncenternewyork.com/gaming-distribution-events/) where people could take their Game Boys and Pokémon cartridges to receive exclusive Pokémon that you couldn't get in game. Some had exclusive moves that they couldn't learn in-game, others could be shiny, and some were legendaries (or a combination of two or three!)

It didn't all go _quite_ to plan but the fact that it worked at all is an impressive feat. For me, it's a great example of taking an idea that already exists and making it your own in a way that almost makes it feel different. I'm super jealous of anyone who got to try it but I'm so that Cilerba made it and that so many people got to (re)live moments from their childhoods!
