I saw this Hydrapple rain team on YouTube and noticed that it was brat themed which meant all the Pokémon were green shinies. While I didn't have a brat summer, I love shinies and thought the theme was really cool. What's more, it was a rain team (my favourite archetype) and it featured [Hydrapple](/nicknames/hydrapple/).

**Team**: Hydrapple / Scizor / Pelipper / Drednaw / Salamence / Jolteon

There isn't a Poképaste but you can view the moves, items, and teras in the video.
