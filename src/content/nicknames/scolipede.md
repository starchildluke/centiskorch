Scolipede was introduced in Generation 5 with a Bug/Poison typing which isn't particularly unique but there's still scope for great nicknames.

## Origins

Scolipede is basically a purple centipede with a shape that doesn't necessary scream "centipede" like our good friend, [Centiskorch](/nicknames/centiskorch/). It's bulky, stands on four legs(?), and it's a red/magenta/purple kind of colour. And apparently, Centiskorch preys on Scolipede. Uh oh!

So let's look at some possible nicknames for this multi-footed bug.

(**Please note**: *some nicknames were suggested by GPT-3.5 Turbo, a large language model [LLM] created by OpenAI. I usually prompt it to give me two lots of lists and I prune them. Most of them don't make the cut and I'll always note if they were from an LLM.*)

## Nicknames

I'm gonna rank these in Smogon tiers: Ubers, OU, UU, RU, NU. Ubers are my favourite/best and NU was me phoning it in.

### Ubers

* **Carnage**
* **Siren** - see "Bermuda" for the rationale
* **Bordeaux** - because of the wine colour
* **Merlot** - see above

### OU

* **Slithe**
* **Cholera**
* **Hot Shoes**
* **Tapdance**
* **Jabba/Jabber**
* **Barb** - because it has a 5% chance of holding a Poison Barb in B2/W2
* **Fever**
* **Crimson**
* **Grim/Reaper** - inspired by a GPT-3.5 Turbo suggestion (Grim Reaper)
* **Plum**

### UU

* **Body-ody-ody**
* **Crouton**
* **Britney** - because Toxic?
* **Prey**
* **Pathogen**
* **Magenta**
* **Mauve**
* **Bermuda** - I looked up the purple colour on a color app and it was called Bermuda Onion and thought, sure why not?
* **Onion**  - see above
* **Tomohiro** - named after its designer, Tomohiro Kitakaze
* **Violet**
* **Menace**
* **Blitz** - GPT-3.5 suggestion
* **Thorne** - adapted from a GPT-3.5 suggestion (Thorn)
* **Amethyst**

### RU

* **Purple Rain** - shame it doesn't learn Rain Dance
* **Purple Haze** - shame it doesn't learn Haze
* **Rollover** - shame it doesn't learn Rolloâ€” oh, it does learn Rollout
