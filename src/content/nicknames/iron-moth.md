Iron Moth was introduced in Generation 9 with a Fire/Poison typing and appears to be the Paradox relative of Volcarona so there's lots of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's have a look at Iron Moth's origins and some of those nicknames.

**Please note**: at the time of writing, this may contain spoilers for the DLC but nothing connected to the storyline.

## Origins

Iron Moth is a robotic-looking moth Pokémon that looks very similar to Volcarona. The main difference is its six diamond-shaped wings that are orange with white speckles and a single black triangle marking on each, and they levitate away from its body.

Name-wise, Iron Moth is made up of Iron and Moth. Shocker!

## Nicknames

I'm gonna rank these by tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.

(**Please note**: *some nicknames were suggested by GPT-3.5 Turbo, a large language model [LLM] created by OpenAI. I usually prompt it to give me two lots of lists and I prune them. Most of them don't make the cut and I'll always note if they were from an LLM. If I have used an LLM for a nickname, I will mark it with an asterisk in brackets.*)

### S-Tier

* **Sunrise** - that's what I named mine!
* **Atlas** - a type of moth
* **Luna** - another type of moth and an ironic name given its appearance

### A-Tier

* **Mothra** - standard nickname for a moth Pokémon
* **David** - after the Star of David from Judaism, a hexagram similar to the one made out of Iron Moth's wings
* **Solomon** - after the Seal of Solomon from Islam, related to above
* **Maize** - because the African sugarcane borer, a type of moth, is a major pest of maize
* **Blaze** - it's a Fire type and has the biggest Special Attack of all Paradox Pokémon
* **Hercules** - a type of moth and it works with the strength element, mentioned above
* **Emperor** - another type of moth and such a majestic name

### B-Tier

* **Buffalo Bill** - from Silence of the Lambs (IYKYK)
* **Battra** - from Godzilla, similar to Mothra
* **SpongeMoth/StarPants** - I wish you could fit both names in, honestly
* **Shiruku** - Japanese for silk, and moths love silk
* **Bombyx** - part of a silk moth's Latin name
* **Stardust** - because of its star shape

### C-Tier

* **Candy Corn** - devisive, I know!
* **Flitter Mane** - just don't use this name in a VGC tournament or they could warn you or ban your Pokémon. Yeah, wild!
* **Frutterbee** - an interpolation of Butterfree
* **Emberwing**(\*) - makes sense
* **i love lamp** - [i love lamp!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gId6nrMDmUU)
