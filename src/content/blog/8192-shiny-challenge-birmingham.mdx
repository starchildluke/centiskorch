I wrote about my time at Birmingham Regionals a few weeks ago. Well, there was another part of it besides the live competition and it was the 8192 Shiny Challenge.

The event, run by Charlie Merriman, involved a group of us shiny hunting for Pokémon in the Gen 2–5 games that had shiny odds of 1/8,192. The idea originated in the US when Kwikpanik and NoralnTheFuture ran the first event of it's kind.

I'll let Charlie do all the talking in the above video but I'll say it was tonnes of fun and I got to meet a lot of awesome people that I hope to see again at a future event.
