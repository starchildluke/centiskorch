Beautifly was introduced in Generation 3 with a dual Bug/Flying typing. It is one of Wurmple's final forms, evolving from Silcoon at Level 10. Given that it's based on a buttefly, there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Beautifly and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Beautifly is a butterfly Pokémon a pair of colorful wings, big blue eyes, and black antennae. The colours on its wings are red, blue, and yellow and it has a long, curled proboscis.

Beautifly like to live in forests and competes with Combee for nectar.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Beautifly nicknames!
