Snorlax was introduced in Generation 1 with a Normal typing and a Gigantamax form so there's plenty of inspiration for a nickname.

With that said, here are some facts about Snorlax and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Snorlax is a big bear-like creature who loves to eat. And its Japanese name (Kabigon) is based on Kirby's Japanese name (<span lang="ja">Kābī</span>). Did I mention that Snorlax loves to eat?

Besides its insatiable appetite, Snorlax also loves to sleep hence the snor- part of its name. A random but interesting fact: Snorlax is the only black Pokémon introduced in Generation I, according to Bulbapedia but I guess you wouldn't have known/considered that given Gen 1 games were in monochrome (unless you played Yellow on a Game Boy Color).

(**Please note**: *some nicknames were suggested by GPT-3.5 Turbo, a large language model [LLM] created by OpenAI. I usually prompt it to give me two lots of lists and I prune them. Most of them don't make the cut and I'll always note if they were from an LLM.*)
