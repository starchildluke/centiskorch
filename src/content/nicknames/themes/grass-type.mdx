Grass types are some of the most serene Pokémon in the franchise and a valuable counter to all the Water Pokémon out there. Grass is also one of three core types as you can get one as a starter/Partner Pokémon at the beginning of the game. So if you're picking a nickname, you'll want something that really stands out. 

Popular Grass types include Bulbasaur, Chikorita, Celebi, Shaymin, and Meowscarada.

## Nicknames

My methodology for picking grass themed nicknames is as follows:

* I will list some games from the franchise and note down characters from each
* I will then assign Pokémon I think would match well with those characters
* It might be that some characters lend themselves well to more than one Pokémon, particular if they're based on regular animals such as fish or horses
* I will only mention fully evolved Pokémon (if they evolve) but if you don't plan to evolve the Pokémon in question, the name should still fit
