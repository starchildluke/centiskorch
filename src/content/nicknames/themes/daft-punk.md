Daft Punk is one of my favourite music groups ever so I thought why not see what nicknames I could make from their songs? You may know them for songs like One More Time and Harder Better Faster Stronger so expect some cool picks!

## Nicknames

My methodology for picking Daft Punk themed nicknames is as follows:

- I will list song titles from their back catalogue and match them with Pokémon I think suit those names
- I'll split them by album and remove any songs that I can't fit into 12 characters
- It might be that some songs lend themselves to more than one Pokémon
- I've left some off that weren't specific to anything
