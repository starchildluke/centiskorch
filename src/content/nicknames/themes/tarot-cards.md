Tarot cards are used by tarot cards readers to look into your past, present or future to help you gain insight in life. A traditional tarot deck contains 78 cards, split into two groups and some of the main cards work perfectly with Pokémon in terms of nicknames.

## Nicknames

My methodology for picking tarot themed nicknames is as follows:

* I will list some games from the franchise and note down characters from each
* I will then assign Pokémon I think would match well with those characters
* It might be that some characters lend themselves well to more than one Pokémon, particular if they're based on regular animals such as fish or horses
* This is a work in progress
