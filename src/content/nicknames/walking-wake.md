Walking Wake was introduced in Generation 9 with a dual-type Water/Dragon typing and, being a Paradox Pokémon related to Suicune, there's plenty of inspiration for a nickname.

So let's look at some facts about Walking Wake and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Walking Wake is a two-legged dinosaur Pokémon with white, diamond-shaped markings on its cyan blue body. It has a tail split into two which is mostly white and shares its long purple with Suicune, although the ends are a red and orange gradient near the top.

Inspiration wise, Walking Wake is likely based on dinosaurs like the velociraptor and other theropod dinosaurs. And Suicune of course.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from.
