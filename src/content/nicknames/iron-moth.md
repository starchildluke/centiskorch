Iron Moth was introduced in Generation 9 with a Fire/Poison typing and appears to be the Paradox relative of Volcarona so there's lots of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's have a look at Iron Moth's origins and some of those nicknames.

## Origins

Iron Moth is a robotic-looking moth Pokémon that looks very similar to Volcarona. The main difference is its six diamond-shaped wings that are orange with white speckles and a single black triangle marking on each, and they levitate away from its body.

Name-wise, Iron Moth is made up of Iron and Moth. Shocker!

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Iron Moth nicknames!
