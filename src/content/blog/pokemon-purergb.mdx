I found this Pokemon Red/Blue/Green ROMhack called Pokemon PureRGB, described as <q>a purist's enhancement of the game meant to enhance the game without bringing in features from later games.</q>

There are a lot of cool storyline and map changes. It seems like a subtle reimagining of the game's journey rather than a lot of ROMhacks that try to make the older games play like newer ones.

I'll have a play and might write a review in the coming months.
