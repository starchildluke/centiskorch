Yesterday, The Pokémon Company announced that [Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen would be re-released as standalone games on the Nintendo Switch (and Switch 2)](https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/the-pokemon-firered-version-and-pokemon-leafgreen-version-games-are-releasing-on-nintendo-switch). The cost will be $19.99 in the US and £16.99 in the UK. People were excited but people were also enraged. Why? Because of the cost apparently and it was another reason for people to call Nintendo anti-consumer and live their fantasy that Nintendo are up there with war criminals. Grown adults btw.

I've ranted about these very normal people plenty on Bluesky but I wanted to make a non-exhaustive list of things you could do instead of make up false equivalences and wild claims about a $20 game.

1. Play another game (literally any other game, I'm begging you)
2. Go for a walk
3. Eat and/or drink something (we all get hangry and we really should be drinking more water because [dehydration affects brain function](https://www.alzdiscovery.org/cognitive-vitality/blog/can-dehydration-impair-cognitive-function))
4. Play FireRed/LeafGreen on your console—quietly
5. Log off
6. Take a bath or have a shower (honestly, they're so relaxing)
7. Scream into a pillow
8. Dance away that negative energy
9. Draw something (it'll put your hands to better use)
10. Call/text your friend and check in on them (just don't rant to them about the game because they might not care or appreciate unnecessary rage over a $20 game)
11. Do your chores (I know I'm not your mum or dad but that laundry on your chair isn't gonna fold itself)
12. Play a FRLG rom hack because apparently they're soooooo much better
13. Watch a movie
14. Count to 100 in that language you're learning on Duolingo
15. Do a shiny hunt (you can rant about probabilities instead!)
16. [Nickname your Pokémon](/nicknames/)
17. Play Pokémon GO (rants about that game are valid)
18. Make/update your website
19. Do some gardening (garden and weather permitting)
20. Talk to your neighbour
21. Buy some stickers and decorate something
