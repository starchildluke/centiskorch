## History

Dragon Quest is a RPG series created by Japanese game designer Yuji Horii, character designer Akira Toriyama, and composer Koichi Sugiyama.

It was originally developed by Chunsoft and published by Enix (now Square Enix) but is currently developed by Square Enix.

## Premise

While themes and characters differ between games, the basic idea centres on the main character that you play often known as Hero as they try to save a land from the tyranny of an evil enemy. You're joined by a group of party members that differ between games but are regularly comprised of male and female characters.

As it's an RPG, you get classic turn-based combat (with the exception of some spin-offs and Dragon Quest X), recurring monsters via random encounters, and themes of imperialism and monarchism.

## Slime!

I love Slime and its entire family. Look at them! What's _not_ to love?
