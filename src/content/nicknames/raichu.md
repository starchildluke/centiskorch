Raichu was introduced in Generation 1 with an Electric typing, as the evolved form of Pikachu and the final evolution of Pichu. In Generation 7, an Alolan form was introduced with a dual Electric/Psychic typing.

Let's look at some info on Raichu and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Kantonian Raichu (left) is a golden yellow rodent Pokémon with brown ears, brown paws, and brown tipped feet. It has a cream coloured belly and pale yellow cheeks. Its tail is mainly brown with a yellow lightning bolt shape at the end.

Alolan Raichu (right) is a darker shade than Kantonian Raichu with yellow swirly ears, white paws, and white tipped feet. It also has a cream coloured belly and brighter yellow cheeks. Its tail is also mainly brown with a soft-edged yellow lightning bolt shape at the end which is also surfs on via levitation.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Raichu nicknames!
