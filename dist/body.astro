Its hair is white and almost blazing. Its dark grey skin comes from its backstory: when Primeape's rage in its soul became too much to contain, its power increased beyond its body's capabilities and we ended up with this undead monkey with raging fists.\n\nLike Mankey and Primeape, Annihilape takes inspiration from snub-nosed monkeys, Japanese macaques, and baboons. There are other folktale inspirations such as the Japanese onryō and the Basque Basajaun.\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.\n* I may use generative AI for inspiration.

On its back is a face made from black spots and markings, similar to Spinarak. It also has two protuding purple and yellow antennae-like structures.\n\nIn terms of its origins, it's of course based on a spider, particularly the Myrmarachne formicaria which is a species of jumping spider (you'll notice that Spinarak jumps around in Scarlet and Violet). As it spits strings of webs, that characteristic comes from spitting spiders (Scytodidae).\n\nName-wise, it could be a mix of Ariadne, a princess from Greek mythology, which lead to terms like arachnid (the Latin for spider), and _maybe_ dos for two because it was the second Pokémon in its evolutionary line and it has two stinger thingies on its back? It could also derive from the Japanese <span lang=\"ja\">脅す</span> (odosu) meaning \"to threaten\".\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D.

It can regenerate parts of its body and creates auroras when changing forme, which allow it to communicate with other Deoxys.

It looks very similar to Applin except that Dipplin's apple is dripping with red syrup thanks to the Syrupy Apple you need from Kitakami to evolve it. Interestingly, Dipplin appears to be made up of two bodies - one with the head (the fore-wyrm) that pokes out of the top, and one with the tail (the core-wyrm) that pokes out of the back.\n\nNotably, Dipplin's shiny form is gold and its signature move Syrup Bomb also changes colour, from red to gold. To my knowledge, this is the first time a move has changed colour based on its shiny.\n\nName-wise, Dipplin appears to be a portmanteau of dip + Applin. [According to Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dipplin_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Name_origin), its Japanese name \"Kamicchu\" may be <q cite=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dipplin_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Name_origin\">a combination of 果 ka (fruit), 花蜜 kamitsu (nectar), 虫 chū (bug; worm), and カジッチュ Kajicchu (Applin).</q>\n\n## Nicknames\n\ny methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D.

It is grey, has a humanoid shape, and has a long, purple tail (green if it's shiny). It has two stumpy horn-like protusions, purple eyes and a tube that connects its head to its neck.\n\nMewtwo also has two Mega evolution forms: [Mega Mewtwo X](https://sg.portal-pokemon.com/play/pokedex/0150_1) and [Mega Mewtwo Y](https://sg.portal-pokemon.com/play/pokedex/0150_2).\n\nAt the time of its creation, Mewtwo was one of the most powerful Pokémon in the Pokémon World and still remains strong in the face of other legendaries in the franchise. It has featured extensively in the anime (both the series and multiple films) and the manga and has a deep hatred of humans due to how it was created and subsquently treated. An example of this is when Mewtwo escape Dr Fuji's lab, where it was created, and worked for Giovanni of Team Rocket. He was placed in a mecha suit and used to beat trainers in Giovanni's Viridian City gym. When Mewtwo realised it was working FOR Giovanni rather than WITH him, he broke from his restraints and journeyed to a new island to create his own land of Pokémon clones away from humans.\n\nIn the games, diaries found in the Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island stated that Mewtwo was born in the Guyanan jungles. Scientists then took Mewtwo and held it captive in the Mansion before studying the Pokémon. Eventually, it broke free and found the Cerulean Cave where it lives in the Kanto games (RBY, FRLG, and LGPE).\n\nName-wise, Mewtwo is literally Mew + two, signifying its cloned status of Mew. By association, Mew may also reference the sound a cat makes due to both of their feline features.\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D.

In the DLC storyline, Ogerpon was said to live with a human centuries ago in Kitakami (where the Teal Mask DLC is based). Villagers shunned them due to their strange appearances but they blended in once they were wore masks, made by a local mask-maker. In fact, the masks made them famous but three greedy Pokémon called Okidogi, Munkidori, and [Fezandipiti](/nicknames/fezandipiti/), stole them from Ogerpon in his cave and his human companion seemed to disappear in the aftermath. When Ogerpon returned, it attacked the trio and slayed them.\n\nThe villagers shunned Ogerpon once again, not knowing what had happened, and instead lionised the fallen three, naming them the \"Loyal Three\" and made a shrine for them. Ogerpon went back to its cave never to be seen my humans again (until you play the DLC of course). However, the Festival of Masks lived on and that's what drew Ogerpon out once again.\n\nThe four masks that the local mask-maker made for Ogerpon give allow it to take four different forms:\n\n* When Ogerpon wears the Teal Mask, it transforms into its Teal Mask form, which remains a pure Grass-type.\n* When Ogerpon wears the Wellspring Mask, it transforms into its Wellspring Mask form, which makes it a dual Grass/Water typing.\n* When Ogerpon wears the Hearthflame Mask, it transforms into its Hearthflame Mask form, which makes it a dual Grass/Fire typing.\n* When Ogerpon wears the Cornerstone Mask, it transforms into its Cornerstone Mask form, which makes it a dual Grass/Rock typing.\n\nIt's always worth noting that Ogerpon is always female.\n\nName-wise, Ogerpon appears to be a portmanteau of ogre + <em>-pon</em>, a Japanese suffix added to names as a <q cite=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ogerpon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Name_origin\">form of endearment</q>.\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D.

Not sure why this is but keep that in mind!\n\n## Origins\n\nPecharunt is a small purple Pokémon that looks like a piece of mochi. In its shell, it has two ear-like protusions on the top and a small point at the bottom. There is a small black circle in the middle of its face with two white crescent-shaped markings, which look like eyes. When opened, we see the Pokémon inside which looks more like a dark purple radish. It has a long \"ponytail\" with a pink coloured end, a white band-like mark across its forehead, two blobs for eyebrows, white eyes and a bowtie-shaped mouth. And two little pink hands. You can also see the inside of the shell segments which are light pink.\n\n[According to Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pecharunt_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Game_data), Pecharunt created the Loyal Three (Okidogi, Munkidori, and [Fezandipiti](/nicknames/fezandipiti/)) and transformed them using its toxic mochi. The toxic chains are a physical representation of their forced bond. Because of all this, it has a rivalry with Ogerpon as described in the main story of the The Teal Mask DLC.\n\nName-wise, Pecharunt sounds like a combination of the Pecha Berry (itself based on a peach) and the word \"runt\". It's Japanese name also references [Momotarō](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momotar%C5%8D), a Japanese folklore hero known as \"Peach Boy\".\n\n</details>\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D.

This \"fur\" is also present in the front part of its body.\n\nAlthough not confirmed, its origins come from a combination of:\n\n* the Galápagos green turtle or Galápagos tortoise\n* the mythical World Turtle\n* the Japanese minogame\n* the diamondback terrapin\n\n## Nicknames\n\nMy methodology for nicknames is as follows:\n\n* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D.

As a Wolfe fan, I've enjoyed them all but having deleted my Twitter at the end of last year, and feeling particularly awful this month because January is always a crap month for my mental health, I needed a pick-me-up and remembered that tweet. And that's when I decided to make my own version:\n\n> 2023 WAS FOR SUCKERS 2024 IS FOR DRAGONS\n\nIs it a rip-off? Yeah, probably. But it's a _topical_ rip-off because 2024 is the Year of the Dragon, according to the Chinese zodiac, and what better way to celebrate than to tie all my mental efforts into dragons and Pokémon. After all, Chinese culture has featured heavily in the franchise, with Pokémon such Emboar, Reshiram, Zekrom, Altaria, and the Treasures of Ruin.\n\nFor the last few weeks, whenever I thought about that mantra, it put a fire in my belly to keep going and power through the darkness. Then tonight, I went on Pokémon Violet for a draft league match (spoiler alert: I lost) and noticed there was a Shelgon outbreak. My mind went back to that motto and I knew what to do:\n\n1. I'd catch two shiny Shelgon\n2. I'd evolve one, and keep the other unevolved\n3. I'd transfer up an [event shiny Bagon](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_local_Japanese_event_Pok%C3%A9mon_distributions_(Generation_V)#Bagon) from Pokémon Black\n4. I'd take photos with them and reinforce my 2024 goals, for the aesthetic\n\nSo after the match, I spent the next 3-5 hours searching for a shiny Shelgon. I even tried the Academy Special meal with Level 1 Sparkling Power as I was low on Herba Mystica, but to no avail (unsurprisingly). I also tried to do some 6* Raids to see if I'd get any drops but luck wasn't on my side this time and after a few defeats, I felt like I was wasting precious time and eventually went back to the hunt.\n\nMinutes went by with nothing; spawning and respawning the same regular degular Shelgon...\n\nAnd then, it finally appeared!\n\nI saved and tried to figure out what ball to use. I tried a Quick Ball first, just in case but nothing.\n\n<q>Maybe a Dive Ball? No. Not an Ultra Ball this time... how about a Dusk Ball? That'll match because Salamence is green and I'm in a cave!</q>\n\nIt required a Spore + False Swipe combo from my trusty Breloom but I got it and I named her **Charlotte** (as a pun on 'shallot', since I decided to give both Shelgon onion-related names.) It was an ordeal to get one shiny Shelgon—how was I going to find a second? Well, the shiny gods threw me a bone and I found a second one minutes later. I saved, threw a Dusk Ball first time and got the all-important critical capture. This one was male so I went for **Rap Scallion** as its nickname.\n\nNow, all I had to do was transfer the Bagon into my Violet save, evolve **Rap Scallion**, and set up a picnic to get the photos.\n\nAnd here they are!\n\n<div class=\"img-center\">\n\t<picture>\n\t\t<source srcset=\"/images/luke-shiny-bagon.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t\t<img src=\"/images/luke-shiny-bagon.jpeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" alt=\"my character in Pokémon Violet, a young dark skinned black boy with a curly hi-top, posing with a shiny dragon Pokémon called Bagon\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\t</picture>\n\t<picture>\n\t\t<source srcset=\"/images/luke-charlotte-shiny-shelgon.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t\t<img src=\"/images/luke-charlotte-shiny-shelgon.jpeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" alt=\"my character in Pokémon Violet, a young dark skinned black boy with a curly hi-top, posing with a shiny dragon Pokémon called Shelgon\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\t</picture>\n\t<picture>\n\t\t<source srcset=\"/images/luke-rap-scallion-shiny-salamence.webp\" type=\"image/webp\">\n\t\t<img src=\"/images/luke-rap-scallion-shiny-salamence.jpeg\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" alt=\"my character in Pokémon Violet, a young dark skinned black boy with a curly hi-top, posing with a shiny dragon Pokémon called Salamence\" loading=\"lazy\">\n\t</picture>\n</div>\n\n2023 WAS FOR SUCKERS 2024 IS FOR DRAGONS!

This comes in handy when the Pokémon is red/orange/yellow, already in my Pokédex, and I have Repeat Balls. But for legendaries (outside of Tera Raids where the catch rate is 100% on all balls), it's a little trickier.\n\nMy latest attempt was at catching Lunala in a Moon Ball (because aesthetic). If you're wondering where Lunala is located in Pokémon Violet, it's on the west coast of Paldea, north of Porto Marinada at the edge of a cliff ([this YouTube video by astephen68 should help you find the precise location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5hFqMuk1Xk)). You'll need to complete 10 BBQ's before talking to Snacksworth and he will tell you a story of how he saw Lunala when he was younger.\n\nAfter I'd done all that, I quickly looked up the odds of catching it in a Moon Ball while in the red and asleep and found that there was about a 6–7% chance per throw. Lunala's regular catch rate is 3 (or 1.567% with a Poké Ball at full health) so better but not great. My problem? **I only had three Moon Balls.**\n\nI already had Pokémon ready to bring it into the red and put it to sleep:\n\n* Brutus the Breloom, with Spore and False Swipe\n* Clippers the Scizor, with False Swipe\n* SprayCharles the Blastoise, with Yawn and Icy Wind\n\nImmediately, I spotted an issue: Lunala is a Ghost-type is immune to False Swipe, a Normal-type move. Because of that, I just used Brutus's Bullet Seed, hoped it wouldn't hit 5 times and KO (spoiler alert: it did a few times), put it to sleep and throw balls. This strategy didn't work.\n\nPlan B was a little more involved. I still used Brutus's Bullet Seed strat but swapped into SprayCharles when it was in the yellow to Icy Wind and Yawn before throwing balls. I got some triple jiggles but they all broke out. Damn you! The only thing that could guarantee 1HP on Lunala was False Swipe but how could I use it? That's when I looked it up and Google jogged my memory:\n\n<q>Foresight!</q>\n<q>Oh. It's not been available since Gen 7. Crap.</q>\n<q>Odor Sleuth!</q>\n<q>Oh. It's not been available since Gen 7 either. Double crap.</q>\n\nFurther searches brought up an interesting item that I'd seen in passing during my Violet playthrough: the Ring Target. It costs <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"7.25\" height=\"10\" viewBox=\"0 0 72.5 100\"><title>Pokédollar symbol</title><desc>A Pokédollar symbol, similar to the Japanese yen symbol or Russian ruble.</desc><path style=\"fill-rule:evenodd\" fill=\"#472a2d\" stroke=\"#472a2d\" stroke-width=\"2\" d=\"m 5,61 -5,0 0,10 5,0 0,6 -5,0 0,10 5,0 0,13 10,0 0,-13 38,0 0,-10 -38,0 0,-6 38,0 0,-10 -38,0 0,-6 30,0 C 60.187841,55 72.499988,42.68783 72.499988,27.5 72.499988,12.31217 60.187841,0 45,0 L 5,0 C 4.4936324,24.995341 5,47.667156 5,61 Z M 15,45 45,45 C 54.66499,45 62.499992,37.164983 62.499992,27.5 62.499992,17.835017 54.66499,10 45,10 l -30,0 z\" /></svg>10,000 and removes move immunity. _Great_, I thought, I'll just give that to Brutus and fire away. But then I realised the Ring Target only removes immunity from the Pokémon **holding** it. I was starting to feel very silly given how many hours I've been playing this game alone, never mind the whole damn franchise over the last quarter century!\n\nFinally, my brain kicked into gear. I had Gholdengo in my team and it could Trick the Ring Target onto Lunala, then Brutus could False Swipe and Spore and then I'd throw balls. I tried it the first time and while False Swipe connected (yay!), none of my 3 balls caught it (boo!)\n\nBut then I tried it a second time.\n\nBall 1: No shakes.  \nBall 2: Three shakes... broke out  \nBall 3: 1... 2... 3...  \n\n\\*_click!_\\*\n\nAnd here it is.\n\n<div class=\"img-center\">\n\t<img src=\"/images/spectra-lunala.jpeg\" alt=\"a screenshot of Lunala\" width=\"630px\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n</div>\n\nI named it Spectra, after the Spectral bat, one of the largest bat species in world.\n\n<div class=\"img-center\">\n\t<img src=\"/images/me-lunala-pose-1.jpeg\" alt=\"my character in Pokémon Violet, posing with Lunala\" width=\"630px\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"img-center\">\n\t<img src=\"/images/me-lunala-pose-2.jpeg\" alt=\"my character in Pokémon Violet, posing with Lunala who is asleep\" width=\"630px\" loading=\"lazy\"/>\n</div>\n\nSo, to those asking if the Moon Ball is the best ball for Lunala, I say... hell yeah! I'm also excited to use Lunala when they allow Restricted Pokémon in VGC. It's a bit of a beast.\n\nIf you're struggling to find Lunala"},{"title":"Awesome Pokémon illustrations by Julesdrawz","body":"\nJulesdrawz is an illustrator and 2D animator with an eye for detail and stunning colours.

I'd recently discovered the shiny and thought I'd give it a go. The problem was the outbreak was a little... off. Clawitzer only seemed to appear 1-4 times per spawn and mostly just once. And I couldn't go directly into the area; I had to slowly creep _towards_ it to conjure the blue crustacean. I managed to get the 60 and spend the next few hours going in and out of spawn area, hoping the red shiny would appear. But it never did. I even tried sandwiches, and that's where the big shiny luck started.\n\nWith one Water sandwich I found the following shinies:\n\n* 2 Buizel\n* 2 Floatzel\n* 1 Gyarados\n\nIt got to the point where I was dreading seeing another shiny weasel. GIMME MY CRUSTACEAN!\n\nIn the end, I gave up and went for Plan B: forcing an outbreak somewhere else. I did this by standing in the biome of the Pokémon I wanted (in this case, it was \"Ocean\"), and day skipping until a Clawitzer outbreak appeared on my map. I found one eventually—albeit in a different location to where I was standing—but I headed straight there. The good news was that spawns were regular, as intended. So I got my 60 and went straight for the sandwich.\n\nAs soon as I put the picnic away, it appeared in the water. My beautiful red and blue Clawitzer. After numerous attempts at catching it in a Great Ball, I finally got my critical capture and shiny Clawitzer was all mine.\n\n<div class=\"img-center\"><img src=\"/images/shiny-clawitzer.jpg\" width=\"620px\" height=\"388px\" alt=\"The Pokémon summary screen for my shiny Clawitzer.

After knocking out the 60 and resetting the spawns... I finally got one. [2024 IS FOR DRAGONS](/blog/2023-suckers-2024-dragons/)! I named it Pistachio because of its green tint and it was [Pistachio Day](https://cultrface.co.uk/its-pistachio-day/) on 26th.\n\nAnd then there was the [Pokémon Presents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qi4COrQ7aA). The biggest announcements for me were new Gen 1 Tera Raids, TCG Pocket, a new TCG game for mobile and the new Legends game, Pokémon Legends: Z-A.\n\n## Gen 1 Tera Raids\n\nWe're getting Tera Raids for the Gen 1 starters on the following dates:\n\n* Mighty Venusaur - Wednesday, February 28 to Tuesday, March 5\n* Mighty Blastoise - Wednesday, March 6 to Tuesday, March 12\n* Mighty Charizard - Wednesday, March 13 to Sunday, March 17\n\nThe good news is that they drop Herba Mystica at a rate of 3%. As usual, you can only catch them once, they're shiny locked, and for Charizard, if you caught it in December 2022, you can't catch it again.\n\nBlastoise is my all-time fave and the Herba drops are amazing so I'm enjoying them so far. I've beaten Venusaur a few times with a Chesnaught and I'm sure the other raids will be easy to do.\n\n## Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket\n\n[Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket](https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/) (or TCG Pocket for short) will be an iOS and Android game, created by Creatures Inc. and DeNA. In it, you can collect TCG cards via two free booster packs every day and get exclusive cards with some immersive art. You can also play some quick games between devices which looks fun and maybe easier than the full TCG Live platform.\n\nI think TCG Pocket looks like a lot of fun and I like that you can get free stuff (although I'm sure there'll be microtransactions if DeNA are involved). I'm not sure how this will work alongside TCG Live, which also has a mobile app to do much of the same things but time will tell.\n\n## Pokémon Legends: Z-A\n\nAnd last but not least: Pokémon Legends: Z-A.\n\nIt was a curveball that only diehard Gen 6 fans saw coming (apparently) and it left some people disappointed, expecting Gen 5 remakes, a Gen 2 Legends game, or re-releases of the Gen 1 games. All we know so far is that it will be set in an \"urban development area\" of Lumiose City and feature a variety of Gen 6 Pokémon. Oh, and the big one: Megas are coming back!\n\nFor me, I'm hyped. I loved Legends: Arceus and I'd love to experience Gen 6 in a proper 3D format. I only played with Megas in Let's Go so I don't have a deep connection with the mechanic. But I'm looking forward to seeing how the games pan out. I'm not into the myriad of theories and predictions for what we might expect so I will wait and enjoy what comes.\n\nAfter the Pokémon Presents, I decided to go after a shiny Salazzle and after a couple of attempts, I actually got one. The RNG gods were on my side!"},{"title":"10 Pokémon I'm excited to use in Regulation E","body":"\nSo this is the last month of Regulation D and, honestly, it has flown by. I remember when everyone was losing their minds in the run-up to its release and then it was the format for Worlds and eventually, people calmed down. But with Regulation E, we're getting a lot of new Pokémon available from HOME so I've picked out a few I'd love to try on the competitive ladder.\n\n## 1. Poliwhirl/Poliwrath/Politoed\n\n<div class=\"img-center\" style=\"margin-top:1rem;\">\n\t<img src=\"/images/sprites/gen1/poliwhirl_061_rby.png\" alt=\"Poliwhirl\" width=\"56px\" height=\"56px\"/>\n\t<img src=\"/images/sprites/gen1/poliwrath_062_rby.png\" alt=\"Poliwrath\" width=\"56px\" height=\"56px\"/>\n\t<img src=\"/images/sprites/gen2/186.png\" alt=\"Politoed\" width=\"56px\" height=\"56px\"/>\n</div>\n\nThat's three different Poliwag evolutions and they all do different things. Kinda. So you might be thinking \"why would you use a middle stage evolution instead of Poliwrath or Politoed?\" Well, Poliwhirl gets access to Eviolite which gives it more bulk than Poliwrath. It also gets abilities like Swift Swim and Water Absorb which, depending on your strat, can give you extra speed with your support or extra support with your support. The latter will be particularly hand for switching into Urshifu Surging Strikes. I was looking for an example of Eviolite Poliwhirl and found [a team made by Pokésports for the SwSh ladder back in Series 12 last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5mBkSxKTLY). It wasn't the best showcase but [you can check out the Poképaste for move/spread ideas](https://pokepast.es/28751d2acb2c0ea9).\n\nPoliwrath is an alternative Water/Fighting type to Urshifu if you want... more special defense I guess? Okay, so it's not a _good_ alternative but maybe you could give it a Choice item, pair it with a Tornadus with Rain Dance and Tailwind, give it Poison Jab and hey presto, it's a Flutter Mane counter! What do you mean I'm clutching at straws???\n\nFinally, we have Politoed and I actually have a history with the big frog as I used it a lot as my rain setter before Kyogre was allowed in SwSh VGC. Besides having Drizzle, it's also very bulky and a great support Pokémon with a lot of great support moves and disruptive moves like Encore, Icy Wind, and Perish Song if you're into that style of play. I managed to get some shiny Poliwag which I evolved so I have access to shiny forms of all of these.\n\n## 2. Snorlax\n<div class=\"img-center\" style=\"margin-top:1rem;\">\n\t<img src=\"/images/sprites/gen1/snorlax_143_rby.png\" alt=\"Snorlax\" width=\"56px\" height=\"56px\"/>\n</div>\n\n[Snorlax](/nicknames/snorlax/) has defined metas in the past and it's a great choice for extreme bulk and attack. And let's not forget that wide movepool and it'll be interesting to see how it fares in SV.\n\n## 3. Sentret\n\nSentret, for all intents and purposes, sucks in VGC. Even in Little Cup it sucks. But I thought: what if I tried it anyway? And so I theorycrafted a team:\n\n**Sentret @ Focus Sash  \nAbility: Frisk  \nLevel: 50  \nEVs: 252 Atk  \nAdamant Nature**  \n\n**\\- Protect  \n\\- Sucker Punch  \n\\- Helping Hand  \n\\- Follow Me/Baby Doll Eyes** \n\nIt also gets Trick so you could try some Choice item swapping? It's silly. But I'm in the mood for silliness in Reg E.\n\n## 4. Milotic\n\nMilotic was a PAIN in SwSh. It had Competitive, Scald, Coil, and it ultimately wouldn't leave the field. Now it's my turn to try it. I'm not sure on the accessibility of Scald but it'll be a welcome addition to the game with its power and burn chance. And with Intimidate still around, there's a lot of opportunity for Milotic to make a name for itself again.\n\n## 5. Dusclops\n\nDusclops was also a PAIN in SwSh. It was a key Trick Room setter and would frustrate players who couldn't get rid of it. Cresselia has been a good bulk TR Pokémon but Dusclops + Eviolite knocks it off the top spot in terms of bulk (to compensate for its abysmal HP).\n\n## 6. Yanmega\n\nYanmega intrigues me. It has decent speed and special offense and access to moves like Bug Buzz, Air Slash, Hypnosis, Screech, Shadow Ball... I'm clutching at straws again. But it does also get Speed Boost and that gave Ninjask a niche in SwSh so there's hope for the big bug.\n\n## 7. Conkeldurr\n\n<div class=\"img-center\" style=\"margin-top:1rem;\">\n\t<img src=\"/images/sprites/gen5/conkeldurr.png\" alt=\"Conkeldurr\" width=\"96px\" height=\"96px\"/>\n</div>\n\nAs I wrote on [my Gen 5 faves page](/favourites/my-favourite-gen-5-pokemon/), I have a soft spot for Conkeldurr and I'd like to try it on ladder having seen what Wolfe Glick win an International Challenge with it in May 2020 and well, everyone else from 2011–2021. It's built a bit like Ursaluna with its super high attack, high HP and defense and slow speed. And it gets Guts. Like Ursaluna. But Iron Fists is also an option to boost its punching moves like Drain Punch. The possibilities are endless here.\n\n## 8. Chandelure\n\n<div class=\"img-center\" style=\"margin-top:1rem;\">\n\t<img src=\"/images/sprites/gen5/chandelure.png\" alt=\"Chandelure\" width=\"96px\" height=\"96px\"/>\n</div>\n\nMy flaming chandelier is back and ready to cause ghostly havoc on the meta. It's a glass cannon for sure but it's a powerful one at that. It's worth noting that Chandelure has a stronger Shadow Ball and more defence than Flutter Mane but that's where the comparisons end. It's a frail baby but maybe it could do something in the meta.\n\n## 9. Trevenant\n\nThe ghostly tree, the undead Sudowoodo—Trevenant is back and it's ready to Harvest and Horn Leech the meta. It's also another Ghost/Grass type to counter Urshifu, in the spot that Brambleghast has been occupying since everyone jumped on that bandwagon a few weeks ago. It's Attack is only 5 points less than the spectral tumbleweed but it's bulkier, albeit slower. I think we'll see some use of this thing and it'll disrupt matches in the right hands.\n\n## 10. Charjabug/Vikavolt\n\nSo apparently Eviolite Charjabug was a thing back in the day and I'd love to try it now. It also has the ability Battery which boosts allies' special attack by 1.3x, which is a free Life Orb without the recoil. Unlike, say, Stonjourner, Charjabug is way bulkier and can stick around longer to maybe add further power to its partner with Helping Hand, provide speed control with Sticky Web or Thunder Wave, or set up screens. Or Screech. There's a lot to go on here if you wanted to try this little thing.\n\nAnd last but not least, it's Vikavolt. I used one in my Ultra sun playthrough and it's a beast. 145 Special Attack on a Bug type? That's more than Volcarona. Unfortunately, it's quite frail and very slow (45 Spe) so maybe it could be have Focus Sash and cause chaos in Trick Room? The potential is there anyway.\n\nWhat would you like to use in Reg E.

But I'm currently bored of the recent games and constantly find myself going back to older ones to maintain the enjoyment.\n\nI want to be clear: I did enjoy Scarlet and Violet when they came out and completed the games within a week or so and got into shiny hunting and VGC. But after just under a year and a DLC, I'm just... tired. The games don't have much to them after you've done everything and because of my personal experiences with shiny hunting (note: I've been incredibly lucky with my shinies), I've exhausted that element of the game. I'm very grateful for that and don't take it for granted but I also don't feel like it's worth forcing further gameplay when I'm not enjoying it. Shiny hunting shouldn't be a chore, and neither should VGC or merely exploring an environment with constant lag.\n\nSo where does that leave me? Well, I'm taking a break from SV until the new DLC drops (whenever that is). Because of all the new Pokémon it'll have, the storyline, the ability to get starters, and lots of new moves and legendaries, it'll negate everything I've written here. Or my current feelings will return in about a year's time once I've rinsed out the second DLC. I'm starting to feel that with Pokémon games more as time goes on. But luckily there are 8 other generations in this franchise so my boredom never lasts long.\n\nUntil then, I'll find something to do. If you've experienced something similar, [email me](mailto:me@centiskor.ch) and let me know."},{"title":"Pokémon that learn Trick Room and Tailwind","body":"\nSometimes you want Tailwind for speed control and sometimes you want Trick Room. But what if you wanted both and didn't have space for two separate Pokémon for each one? Well, you could have the best of both worlds because there are 13 Pokémon (at the time of writing) that can learn both Tailwind and Trick Room.\n\nI've listed them below and will update it with levels and methods of learning both moves when I get a chance.\n\n* Arceus\n* Lunala\n* Mew\n* Comfey\n* Siglyph\n* Whimsicott\n* Natu/Xatu\n* Woobat/Swoobat\n* Galarian Articuno\n* Drifloon/Drifblim"},{"title":"Pokemon types have more immunities than you realize","body":"import {YouTube} from 'astro-lazy-youtube-embed'\n\n<div class=\"yt-embed\">\n\t<YouTube title={frontmatter.title} videoId=\"oGrUdIWHTQ8\" />\n</div>\n\nPortobelloMushroom posted an interesting video on Pokémon immunities and how there are more than we realise, beyond things like Dark's immunity to Psychic, and Ground's immunity to Electric.\n\nI think it's good to know all of these for teambuilding, particularly in metas where certain Pokémon are more popular than others."},{"title":"A prediction for Pokémon Day 2024","body":"\nA few weeks ago, [PKMNcast made a prediction on his podcast](https://youtu.be/GyI3WgiPZGg?si=KWLTmgkXvJ_4OPU1&t=10225) that The Pokémon Company would have a shiny Rayquaza raid for Pokémon Day, \"to line up with the anime\" (spoiler alert: shiny Rayquaza featured in the latest anime series). I thought that would be an awesome idea and I've not stopped thinking about it since, not least because shiny Rayquaza is **gorgeous**. But after my dragon themed evening yesterday, I took the idea a step further...\n\nWhat if, instead of a standard 7* raid where you defeat the Pokémon and just catch it, they replicated the shiny Zeraora event from Sword and Shield where a million people had to defeat it in a Max Raid in order for them to get the shiny version in Pokémon HOME? By making it a global effort, it'd draw more people to the raid—probably more than ever before in SV—and it'd be an opportunity for people to do group raids rather than solo.\n\nOf course, all of this is conjecture and I don't think my idea will happen, and it's not certain that PKMNcast's prediction will be right either (although [I want to believe](https://newrepublic.com/article/126715/x-files-i-want-believe-posters-origin-story)). But if there's one unexpected announcement coming on Pokémon Day, let it be that."},{"title":"Quick thoughts on Pokémon cards","body":"\n(originally written on 18th Jan 2024)\n\nMass production fascinates me. It starts with creating something in abundance and people consuming it, marking certain parts more valuable than others, regardless of the effort put into all of it. Take Pokémon cards for example.\n\nThe artwork has been amazing for decades now, but if it's not a pull, a lot of people don't care (unless they need 1 of each of the \"trash\" cards to complete a collection). There are TONNES of content creators who push this narrative to the point that I've seen cards get CUT UP for views.\n\nImagine, as one of those artists, seeing that happen to your work because it's not worth lots of money or good for clout. But TPCi likely doesn't care as long as money is made and Pokémon remains relevant. And it saddens me to see. \n\nI have a collection of my own and I enjoy looking at all the cards, especially the cards that aren't worth much. The lines, the colours, the details, the creativity. I'd be more likely to buy up all the cheap cards based on the art or my fave Pokémon than spending £££ on some rares."},{"title":"Quick thoughts on Pokémon fan demands","body":"\n(originally written on 3rd April 2021)\n\nConsumers need to understand that commercial products can’t satisfy their niche needs AND sell enough to continue production and appease shareholders.\n\nI’m not a defender of capitalism—it’s a system we’re all part of in some way—but as part of that, we’ve seen what it can do to entities that try to please everyone and end up pleasing no one and going out of business.\n\nLike, I’ve seen a lot of Pokémon content creators start playing fan-made games on their streams and saying they wish the main games were like them. But they forget that casual gamers make up more of their market than people wanting hard mode Pokémon games.\n\nWhy the hell would Game Freak build in a meta-esque system by default in that case? If you wanna Nuzlocke… go Nuzlocke. If you wanna play with special rules… self-impose them. Or play the fan-made games as you already are.\n\nReading [Dr. Lava's snippets of Masuda interviews](https://lavacutcontent.com/masuda-interview-pokemon-platinum/) has made me realise he wants to make fun games for all to enjoy with expansive worlds and opportunities for people to make their own stories through them. I think that’s beautiful and it’s worked on me, clearly."},{"title":"Review: Pokémon Crystal Legacy","body":"\nI've played my fair share of Pokémon mods, from games with slight improvements to completely new regions and Pokémon. Pokémon Crystal Legacy isn't the first Crystal mod I've played but it's certainly one of the best.\n\nCrystal Legacy was created by YouTuber and self-proclaimed \"Gen 2 nerd\" [SmithPlays Pokémon](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzSgKn6BC9uYD89Hfut3sBg) as a way of making a version that lives up to Gen 2's hidden potential. It's well known that for all its nostalgic charm, Gold/Silver/Crystal has a lot of flaws and missed opportunities such as:\n\n* terrible level scaling in key parts of the games\n* slow grinding\n* a lack of Gen 2 Pokémon in gym leaders' teams\n* a less-than-competitive post-game\n* a final boss battle with Red that is super difficult if you haven't got your team up to Level 70+\n\nBut Crystal Legacy fixes a lot of this with hand-picked changes that bring the games into the modern day.\n\nI played Crystal Legacy on my new Powkiddy RGB30 and, thanks to speed up, I got through it in a few days and I went with a team of Pokémon I generally don't use:\n\n* Hostgator the Feraligatr\n* Angelfire the Magcargo\n* Lycos the Crobat\n* Tiscali the Beedrill\n* Netscape the Skarmory\n* Winzip the Vileplume\n\nI decided not to play a Nuzlocke so I could enjoy the game but I think adding that element would make this ROM hack even better than it already is.\n\nWhat I liked about the mod was how it changed just enough to get the most of an already good game. The moveset changes meant Pokémon had a better chance to do well throughout the game, such as Beedrill which I could finally use in a playthrough. Probably my favourite story change is how you have to beat the Elite Four for a second time after winning all the Kanto badges. This allows for a better level grinding experience before taking on Red, which was my least favourite part of Gen 2 so I'm glad this was corrected.\n\nSome Pokémon got bigger stat buffs including Magcargo, which I didn't realise until I started writing this review so I chose well for my team! I also enjoyed the improved storyline with Team Rocket which I already found quite entertaining as a kid but this brought it closer to the kind of storylines in Gen 5 (albeit nowhere near as engaging).\n\nYour Rival's storyline is the same but has changes to his team depending on your starter choice. It would have been awesome to add in the Silver-Giovanni father-son storyline but the game wasn't worse for not having it. That said, his team was still super easy to beat so maybe the Pokémon could have been buffed further?\n\nNow, the Elite Four. Finally, a proper challenge! I decided not to keep resetting after losing so I could grind up and it was a lot more fun than the original games. Each Elite Four member had better versions of their OG teams, and some annoyances you have to strategise for (e.g. Koga's Minimize Muk).\n\nOverall, this is probably the best way to play Crystal outside something like Crystal Clear which deviates more from the originals than Crystal Legacy. I recommend you [watch SmithPlays Pokémon's video on the hack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeJBVY3z_uE) and how to install it"},{"title":"VGC law and disorder","body":"\nI'll keep this short and \"stream of consciousness\"-y so here's an opening tl;dr:\n\n> VGC (Video Game Championship, the name Pokémon uses to describe competitive play) annoys me from an organisational perspective.\n\nPokémon's competitive scene has lived in some form for over 25 years, since the days of [Nintendo Cup](https://www.smogon.com/articles/nintendo-cup-1997) in 1997 and the [first World Championships in 2000](https://www.provokemedia.com/latest/article/pokemon-2000-world-championships). It's not a new concept for The Pokémon Company or The Pokémon Company International and yet everything feels like it's in beta with quality of life improvements only trickling through every so often. VGC should be way better than this. And it's not the fault of the event staff; no, I'm laying blame on the top brass - The Pokémon Company.\n\n## I'm not lovin' it\n\nNow, a brief tangent: I saw a really good film a few years ago called [The Founder](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-founder/) about how McDonald's became a multi-billion dollar enterprise. McDonald's sells franchises to prospective owners and makes money of the real estate (in fact, most of their income comes from rent, royalties, and fees).\n\nThat's how The Pokémon Company feels to me.\n\n## Worlds was a mess\n\nThe Pokémon Company International is a subsidary created by TPC to handle \"brand management, licensing, marketing, the Pokémon Trading Card Game, the animated TV series, home entertainment, and the official Pokémon website\". It also manages VGC in every region except Asia. That's because TPC handles Asia and I use \"handle\" very loosely. Staff and organisers have struggled with logistic, organisational, and equipment issues because the people and the hardware just isn't there. Worlds in Japan was supposed to be a monumentous ocassion for all the right reasons but it was an incredible mess. [People were regularly disconnected](https://esi.si.com/pokemon/mass-disconnects-threaten-competitive-integrity-at-pok%C3%A9mon-world-championship), there was a sudden death match (which is supposed to be rare), [there was a lot of disqualifications due to genned/hacked Pokémon](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/pokemon-players-disqualified-from-world-championships-for-using-hacked-pokemon/), [the queues to even get in were hours long in unbearable heat](https://twitter.com/JamesWBaek/status/1697671974489821569), people didn't get their competitor passes or free merch in time. And I'm saying all this as an outsider but the frustration from competitors was real.\n\n## Keeping up appearances\n\nI don't have any solutions. I'm not going to discuss the genning situation because it's honestly boring, the arguments are circular and everyone just argues with false equivalences and faulty morals. It's a game based on data where we reset until we get what we want, let's not forget that. But given TPC's experience and income, there's no excuse for these issues **if they really care about VGC as a competitive element of the business and brand**. It's meant to have a space in eSports and yet it feels like a little sibling trying to join in with their older sibling's games with their mates. And I know TPC doesn't make money off this and that is arguably the main reason why it feels so hands off. But it's branded in a differing light. We get hype from the streams, cool graphics to announce new regulations, more active mentions of VGC in the game itself related to EVs and moves. Maybe it's a free advertising space for them that volunteers, spectators, and competitors pay to keep up. But I digress.\n\nMy ramble is over and anyone who reads this will probably have opinions which I'm welcome to hear if you want to email me. If I've got any facts wrong, I'll correct them. If we don't agree on an opinion, that's all good! Just don't talk to me about genning. I literally don't care anymore.\n\n<smaller>**Update note**: I got it all wrong about who handles what, so I'm very sorry. I'd say that TPCi handled the APAC region but it's actually TPC. TPCi does pretty much all of the heavy lifting. It's wild that they function so separately despite being one of the same thing.</smaller>"}]}
