            "reason": "It's a cheeky chappy that likes to eat and bite. While it isn't my top croc in the game, it's in second. Next playthrough, I'm picking him (because the gender ratio means it's more likely to be male)."

            "reason": "Quaquaval can DANCE. It never stops. I love the carnaval theme and it's a surprise it didn't get Quick Feet as its Hidden Ability (although it wouldn't have been on par with the other final evolution starters haveing Unaware and Protean. But whatever, it's my favourite duck Pokémon and it was expertly designed."

            "reason": "The cutest little Chałka dog (I actually called mine Chalka). It had a brief run in VGC thanks to its Well-Baked Body ability raising its Defense when hit by a Fire move, and Armarouge and Torkoal were all over the place at the time. A great design and a decent Pokémon in battle."

It was my kind of warrior and, even though I've used its counterpart in VGC (Armarouge), I love Ceruledge much more. I love that it has Flash Fire as an Ability, that Grass Tera baits it out and prevents it from sleep, and it has access to moves like Bitter Blade, Shadow Sneak, and Solar Blade. If anything, I wish it had Sharpness as a Hidden Ability given its design but we can't have everything."

But in the SV trailers where they revealed Bellibolt, I was so excited for it being a close substitute. It's a round-bellied frog with a cool ability and decent stats. And it was on my playthrough team."

When it came out, I knew I had to use it in my playthrough. I'd fallen in love with Tauros in Sword/Shield as an alternative Intimidater. It was super fast (base 110 Speed) and was good for proccing Weakness Policies with Bulldoze or Surf (although I haven't used that yet). It's a shame the shiny isn't more distinct."

You were doing so well up to this point), I'm glad it got an evolution, and one that has two forms: Two-Segment Form and Three-Segment Form. The latter is a 1% chance of happening when evolving Dunsparce and, including shiny odds, that's anywhere from 0.0002% to 0.002%. Challenge accepted!"

I love how you can build out its bulk and make it a fast Tailwind setter at the same time.

You can even run it as support with Acid Spray which works well with Flutter Mane or Chi-Yu if you don't mind running double Fire."

Competitively, it's a beast with a huge Special Attack stat and that means I can use it to AFK the Ace Tournament (for the most part; it's not perfect). People hate it for some reason but I love this thing."
