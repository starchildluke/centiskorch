Annihilape was introduced in Generation 9 with a Fighting/Ghost typing as the evolved form of Primeape so there's lots of inspiration for nicknames.

With that said, here are some info about Annihilape and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Annihilape is a simian Pokémon with broken shackles on its ankles and left wrist. Its hair is white and almost blazing. Its dark grey skin comes from its backstory: when Primeape's rage in its soul became too much to contain, its power increased beyond its body's capabilities and we ended up with this undead monkey with raging fists.

Like Mankey and Primeape, Annihilape takes inspiration from snub-nosed monkeys, Japanese macaques, and baboons. There are other folktale inspirations such as the Japanese onryō and the Basque Basajaun.
