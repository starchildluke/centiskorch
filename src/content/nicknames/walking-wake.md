Walking Wake was introduced in Generation 9 with a dual-type Water/Dragon typing and, being a Paradox Pokémon related to Suicune, there's plenty of inspiration for a nickname.

So let's look at some facts about Walking Wake and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Walking Wake is a two-legged dinosaur Pokémon with white, diamond-shaped markings on its cyan blue body. It has a tail split into two which is mostly white and shares its long purple with Suicune, although the ends are a red and orange gradient near the top.

Inspiration wise, Walking Wake is likely based on dinosaurs like the velociraptor and other theropod dinosaurs. And Suicune of course.

(**Please note**: *some nicknames were suggested by GPT-3.5 Turbo, a large language model [LLM] created by OpenAI. I usually prompt it to give me two lots of lists and I prune them. Most of them don't make the cut and I'll always note if they were from an LLM.*)
