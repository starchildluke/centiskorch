			<p>If you love Pokémon nearly as much as I do, and you want to help centiskor.ch grow, there are various ways you can support.</p>
			<h2 class="headings">With money</h2>
			<p>For transparency, the money would go towards domain and hosting costs as well as contibuting towards the time I spend updating the site. And it's nice to financially support the arts!</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/lukealexdavis">You can subscribe to my Patreon.</a> Everyone who pledges gets a free membership card and there are a ton of tier rewards you can get. <strong>Pledges start at $1 per month.</strong></li>

			<h2 class="headings">With love</h2>
			<p>If you're not in a position to donate or otherwise don't want to (totally get that!!) but want to do <em>something</em>, you can help spread the word.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/centiskor.ch">Skeet me</a>. If you're on the blue app, I'll talk to anyone but don't be a bigot and don't get overfamiliar.</li>
				<li><a href="mailto:me@centiskor.ch">Email me</a> stuff you think I’ll like. It beats getting junk!</li>
				<li>Engage with my content. Whether it involves skeets, blog posts, or projects, share them, send emails, and link back to the site.</li>
				<li>Write about me on your own sites and link back. I've written thousands of blog posts and I might have something interesting for you.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At some point, I'll make badges you can put on your sites if you decide to link back.</p>
