Archaludon is a dual-type Steel/Dragon Pokémon, introduced in Generation 9 as the evolved form of Duraludon.

Let's have a look at its origins and some of my suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Archaludon is a metallic, dinosaur-like Pokémon with body similar to the pylon of a suspension bridge. Its body is mainly silver-grey but its underside has a blue criss-crossing pattern (the tower bridge part) mixed with some red.

Like Duraludon, Archaludon takes inspiration from bridges, particularly suspension and folding bridges (basically anything with pylons), as well as bipedal dinosaurs.
