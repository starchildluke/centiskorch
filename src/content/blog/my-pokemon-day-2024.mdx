I'm a couple of days late but I wanted to write about my experiences on Pokémon Day on 27th Feb 2024.

I was very excited for the Pokémon Presents and what TPC would reveal (besides the spin-off games of course!) and started the day with an Bagon outbreak. After knocking out the 60 and resetting the spawns... I finally got one. [2024 IS FOR DRAGONS](/blog/2023-suckers-2024-dragons/)! I named it Pistachio because of its green tint and it was [Pistachio Day](https://cultrface.co.uk/its-pistachio-day/) on 26th.

And then there was the [Pokémon Presents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qi4COrQ7aA). The biggest announcements for me were new Gen 1 Tera Raids, TCG Pocket, a new TCG game for mobile and the new Legends game, Pokémon Legends: Z-A.

## Gen 1 Tera Raids

We're getting Tera Raids for the Gen 1 starters on the following dates:

* Mighty Venusaur - Wednesday, February 28 to Tuesday, March 5
* Mighty Blastoise - Wednesday, March 6 to Tuesday, March 12
* Mighty Charizard - Wednesday, March 13 to Sunday, March 17

The good news is that they drop Herba Mystica at a rate of 3%. As usual, you can only catch them once, they're shiny locked, and for Charizard, if you caught it in December 2022, you can't catch it again.

Blastoise is my all-time fave and the Herba drops are amazing so I'm enjoying them so far. I've beaten Venusaur a few times with a Chesnaught and I'm sure the other raids will be easy to do.

## Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket

[Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket](https://tcgpocket.pokemon.com/en-us/) (or TCG Pocket for short) will be an iOS and Android game, created by Creatures Inc. and DeNA. In it, you can collect TCG cards via two free booster packs every day and get exclusive cards with some immersive art. You can also play some quick games between devices which looks fun and maybe easier than the full TCG Live platform.

I think TCG Pocket looks like a lot of fun and I like that you can get free stuff (although I'm sure there'll be microtransactions if DeNA are involved). I'm not sure how this will work alongside TCG Live, which also has a mobile app to do much of the same things but time will tell.

## Pokémon Legends: Z-A

And last but not least: Pokémon Legends: Z-A.

It was a curveball that only diehard Gen 6 fans saw coming (apparently) and it left some people disappointed, expecting Gen 5 remakes, a Gen 2 Legends game, or re-releases of the Gen 1 games. All we know so far is that it will be set in an "urban development area" of Lumiose City and feature a variety of Gen 6 Pokémon. Oh, and the big one: Megas are coming back!

For me, I'm hyped. I loved Legends: Arceus and I'd love to experience Gen 6 in a proper 3D format. I only played with Megas in Let's Go so I don't have a deep connection with the mechanic. But I'm looking forward to seeing how the games pan out. I'm not into the myriad of theories and predictions for what we might expect so I will wait and enjoy what comes.

After the Pokémon Presents, I decided to go after a shiny Salazzle
