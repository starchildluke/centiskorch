			<p>centiskor.ch was heavily inspired by <a href="https://pincurch.in">pincurch.in</a>, a site I stumbled upon while looking for cool domains, and sites from the 2000s where people just wrote stuff and had fun. A big shout out to <a href="https://seafare.neocities.org/">seafare</a> for basically being the design blueprint for the site.</p>
			<p>The main reason why I chose Centiskorch as the focal point was because the centiskor.ch domain was available. I also had a Centiskorch in my main Pokémon Sword team and it's one of my favourite designs in recent generations.</p>
			<h2 class="headings">Goals</h2>
			<p>I want this site to be two things:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>A Centiskorch fan site.</li>
				<li>A place for me to write about general Pokémon stuff, whether it be about media, VGC, my own playthroughs, nicknames, and general observations.</li>
			</ol>
