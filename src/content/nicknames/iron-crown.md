Iron Crown is a dual-type Steel/Psychic Pokémon, introduced in Generation 9 as a "futuristic relative of Cobalion".

Let's have a look at its origins and some of my suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Iron Crown is a metallic, quadruped Pokémon with body similar to Cobalion. Its body is mainly turquoise but its underside is silver and its horns are a mix of turquoise and yellow. It has light turquoise V-shaped cuffs on its four legs, and yellow-wing like appendages on either side of its body. Given its name and stature, it has a regal posture.

As it is based on Cobalion, it takes inspiration from animals like antelopes and goats, or any member of the bovid family (including gazelles and impalas).

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from.
