Ice types haven't had the best of times in Pokémon but they've had some of the coolest designs which lend themselves to cool nicknames inspired by glaciology or the study of ice and snow.

## Nicknames

My methodology for picking ice themed nicknames is as follows:

* I will list some games from the franchise and note down characters from each
* I will then assign Pokémon I think would match well with those characters
* It might be that some characters lend themselves well to more than one Pokémon, particular if they're based on regular animals such as fish or horses
* I will only mention fully evolved Pokémon (if they evolve) but if you don't plan to evolve the Pokémon in question, the name should still fit
