Shadow Rider Calyrex was introduced in Generation 8 with a Psychic/Ghost typing so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

It is one of Calyrex's additional forms (along with [Ice Rider Calyrex](/nicknames/ice-rider-calyrex/)) which is activated when using the Reins of Unity on Spectrier.

Let's look at some info on Shadow Rider Calyrex and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Shadow Rider Calyrex is the combination of Calyrex, a lepus-like bipedal Pokémon, and Spectier, a black horse with a flowing purple mane. The crown-like piece on Calyrex's head <q cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Calyrex_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">glows bright green when it is using its powers</q>.

With Spectier, Shadow Rider Calyrex can ride a thousand miles in a day and the fusion changes Spectier's spectral aura into a mass that can <q cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Calyrex_(Pok%C3%A9mon)">absorb the life-force and souls of any being's energy like a black hole</q>.

Name-wise, Calyrex derives from the Latin words calyx, meaning 'bud', and rex, meaning 'king'. Shadow Rider references its shadow appearance and... Calyrex is the rider.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
