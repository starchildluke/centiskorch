* 22/08/2023 - Pretty much built the site today but lots more to go.
* 24/08/2023 - Finished the Gen 1 Favourites page and added new layout templates for LCP elements (page speed optimisation, baby!)
* 29/10/2023 - I've done so much, I've forgotten it all. I've written a lot of nickname pages and the Dipplin one is very popular, as is the Ogerpon one (but not as much). I've just been filling the site up bit by bit
