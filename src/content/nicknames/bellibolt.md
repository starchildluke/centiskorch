## Origins and data

			<p>Bellibolt was introduced in Generation 9 with a pure Electric typing. Known as the EleFrog Pokémon, it's a frog-like Pokémon with a big round green body with a grey domed belly that stores electricity. While it has eye-like features on the sides of its head, they aren't actually eyes at all—its eyes are just above its belly with a mouth underneath (see the smile?) This is likely inspired by the Cuyaba dwarf frog.
			<p>In the middle of its belly is a yellow circle where its electricity comes out. It also has little green arms and orange feet. Its the jolliest frog since... Politoed! Despite its base speed, Bellibolt can move quite quickly but chooses not to. I hear that! Its signature ability, Electromorphosis, powers up Electric moves when it is hit before attacking and it is one of five Pokémon to learn Parabolic Charge.</p>
			<p>Bellibolt's English name is a portmanteau of belly + bolt.</p>

			<li>I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) </li>but they'll always be amended where necessary
			<li>I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from</li>
