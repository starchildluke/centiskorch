Mewtwo was introduced in Generation 1 with a pure Psychic typing and, given its iconic status as a powerful legendary, there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Mewtwo and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Mewtwo is a bipedal Pokémon created using the DNA of Mew via gene splicing and DNA engineering. It is gray, has a humanoid shape, and has a long, purple tail (green if it's shiny). It has two stumpy horn-like protusions, purple eyes and a tube that connects its head to its neck.

Mewtwo also has two Mega evolution forms: [Mega Mewtwo X](https://sg.portal-pokemon.com/play/pokedex/0150_1) and [Mega Mewtwo Y](https://sg.portal-pokemon.com/play/pokedex/0150_2).

At the time of its creation, Mewtwo was one of the most powerful Pokémon in the Pokémon World and still remains strong in the face of other legendaries in the franchise. It has featured extensively in the anime (both the series and multiple films) and the manga and has a deep hatred of humans due to how it was created and subsquently treated. An example of this is when Mewtwo escape Dr Fuji's lab, where it was created, and worked for Giovanni of Team Rocket. He was placed in a mecha suit and used to beat trainers in Giovanni's Viridian City gym. When Mewtwo realised it was working FOR Giovanni rather than WITH him, he broke from his restraints and journeyed to a new island to create his own land of Pokémon clones away from humans.

In the games, diaries found in the Pokémon Mansion on Cinnabar Island stated that Mewtwo was born in the Guyanan jungles. Scientists then took Mewtwo and held it captive in the Mansion before studying the Pokémon. Eventually, it broke free and found the Cerulean Cave where it lives in the Kanto games (RBY, FRLG, and LGPE).

Name-wise, Mewtwo is literally Mew + two, signifying its cloned status of Mew. By association, Mew may also reference the sound a cat makes due to both of their feline features.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Mewtwo nicknames!
