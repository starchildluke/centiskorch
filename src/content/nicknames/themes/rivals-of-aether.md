Rivals of Aether is platform fighting game on Xbox One, Steam, and Switch. It's a bit like Smash Bros (to put it crudely) but with characters from non-Nintendo titles and a deeper lore. Given that animals and elemental powers are heavy themes in the game, it lends itself well to Pokémon and nicknames in my opinion.
