Yanma was introduced in Generation 2 with a Bug/Flying typing and evolves into Yanmega when leveled up while knowing the move Ancient Power.

Let's have a look at Yanma's origins and some of those nicknames.

## Origins

Yanma is a red dragonfly-like Pokémon with a green head, four white wings with a single orange stripe on each one, and six legs. Its tail has two flat extensions on either side, similar to a helicopter or light aircraft (more on that comparison in the next paragraph).

It appears to be based on a dragonfly but I definitely see elements of helicopters in its design. Name-wise, Yanma comes from the word "yanma" (<span lang="zh">蜻蜓</span>) meaning "large dragonfly". Nuff said!

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from.

With all that said, let's look at those Yanma nicknames!
