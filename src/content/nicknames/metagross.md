Metagross was introduced in Generation 3 with a Steel/Psychic typing so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Metagross and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Metagross is a robotic Pokémon with a metallic blue body and four legs. Because of its build, it looks like a robot spider (which will inspire the nicknames!). Metagross is the result of two Metang fusing together, in a similar fashion to Magnemite combining to create Magneton. This fusion means that Metagross has four brains making it <q cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Metagross_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Biology">more intelligent than a supercomputer</q>.

Etymologically, Metagross could be a portmanteau of _metal_ and _cross_, or gross referring to its weight. Meta- as a prefix also has associations with technology, AI, and robotics.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Metagross nicknames!
