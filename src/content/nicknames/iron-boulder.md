Iron Boulder was introduced in Generation 9 with a Rock/Psychic typing based on Terrakion so there's plenty of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Iron Boulder and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Iron Boulder is a round Pokémon coated in a reflective metal with a build similar to Terrakion. Its head appears to be fused into its torso, therefore lacking a prominent neck. The collar area is a black band, it has two prodding fin-like parts coming out of its back and horns shaped like blades with thick golden yellow edges. Iron Boulder's four hooves are also cuffed in golden yellow with white sparkles.

As Iron Boulder is based on Terrakion, it appears to be a mix of various bovid species such as long-horned sheep, bulls, and the [takin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takin).

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Iron Boulder nicknames!

### S-Tier

* **FerreroRochr** - So a Ferrero Rocher is a chocolate ball covered in hazelnuts with a praline centre. Rocher is French for boulder. It all fits (except the full name which I had to shorten. And it might not be allowed in VGC so be careful)!
* **Walter** - named after Walter Sobchak, a character from The Big Lebowski (I chose this name as I imagined Iron Boulder's shape as a bowling ball and that film's theme is ten-pin bowling)

### A-Tier

* **Mishmi** - a subspecies of takin
* **Capricorn**
* **Pétanque** - a French sport which uses metal balls, or <span lang="fr">boules</span>
* **Pebbles** - ironic name, given its size and name
* **Bam Bam** - because Pebbles is a Flintstones character and so is Bam Bam
* **Moeraki** - a place where you'll find the Moeraki Boulders, a group of large spherical boulders lying along a stretch of Koekohe Beach in New Zealand

### B-Tier

* **Himalaya** - the habitat of a takin
* **Tibet**
* **Gyro Bull** - Gyro Ball (which it can't learn btw) + bull
* **Meathead** - I dunno, it just looks like one
* **Marbles**
* **Gorge** - rocks, innit?
* **Kei** - Dutch for "boulder"

### C-Tier

* **Phantasm** - it's a horror movie so look it up in your own time and you might see what I mean. Also works with the Psychic vibe
* **Cannonbull**
* **Rotunda**

### D-Tier

* **Massimo** - masso is Italian for boulder and I know Massimo is an Italian name so why not?
* **Blade Runner** - because of the blade horns on its head and its base speed is quite high (124)
