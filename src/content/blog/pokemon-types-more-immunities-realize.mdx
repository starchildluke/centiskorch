PortobelloMushroom posted an interesting video on Pokémon immunities and how there are more than we realise, beyond things like Dark's immunity to Psychic, and Ground's immunity to Electric.

I think it's good to know all of these for teambuilding, particularly in metas where certain Pokémon are more popular than others.
