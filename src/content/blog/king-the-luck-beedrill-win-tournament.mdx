[Beedrill](/nicknames/beedrill/) is my favourite Bug type Pok√©mon. Despite its many flaws, I like the design and it got a Mega form which actually packed a <del>punch</del> sting if it stuck around long enough.

Luckily, King The Luck did it justice and not only brought it to an online singles tournament but won the whole thing! The format was Gen 6 singles with a pool of 30 Pok√©mon to choose from (and Beedrill might not have been the strongest of the 3 Bug types amongst them). But it won and that's all the matters.
