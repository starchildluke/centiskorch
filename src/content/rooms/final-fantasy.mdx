## History

Final Fantasy is a RPG series created by Hironobu Sakaguchi.

It was developed and published by Square before it became Square Enix and they still develop and publish the series to this day.

## Premise

Final Fantasy is known as an anthology series as most of the games don't follow on from each other, covering different themes from disparate worlds and timelines.

The early games were mainly turn-based with the addition of Action Time Battling (ATB) in Final Fantasy IV but later games have opted for more action RPG mechanics.

## My thoughts

I hadn't played any of the games until January 2025 and so far I've completed I, III, IV, V, VI, and VII, and I'm playing IX now. I've got to say the games I've played so far have been a lot of fun. I don't know what I expected or why it took me so long but I've enjoyed the ride so far and I'm excited to dive into the PS2 games.
