Happy Pokémon Day to those who celebrate. With all the hype building for the day, I thought I'd note down my desires for Pokémon Presents airing at 2pm (UTC+0/GMT).

**What's most likely:**

- More about Legends Z-A and a release date
- A new raid event
- A new Masters EX release
- A new Café Remix release
- A new Sleep release

**What's less likely but I'd love:**

- Let's Go! Johto
- Gen 1–3 games on Switch with HOME connectivity
- A new shiny legendary/mythical distribution
- Gen 5 remakes

**What I don't really want:**

- Any information about Gen 10 (I don't think it'll happen though)
- Pokémon Bank closure date
- Another Gastrodon distribution
- Gen 7 remakes
