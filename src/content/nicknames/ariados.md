Ariados was introduced in Generation 2 with a Bug/Poison typing as the evolved form of Spinarak so there's lots of inspiration for nicknames.

Let's look at some info on Ariados and suggested nicknames.

## Origins

Ariados is a red arachnid Pokémon with purple eyes, four purple and yellow striped legs, two fangs, a stinger on its head. On its back is a face made from black spots and markings, similar to Spinarak. It also has two protuding purple and yellow antennae-like structures.

In terms of its origins, it's of course based on a spider, particularly the Myrmarachne formicaria which is a species of jumping spider (you'll notice that Spinarak jumps around in Scarlet and Violet). As it spits strings of webs, that characteristic comes from spitting spiders (Scytodidae).

Name-wise, it could be a mix of Ariadne, a princess from Greek mythology, which lead to terms like arachnid (the Latin for spider), and _maybe_ dos for two because it was the second Pokémon in its evolutionary line and it has two stinger thingies on its back? It could also derive from the Japanese <span lang="ja">脅す</span> (odosu) meaning "to threaten".

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from.
