Ogerpon was Legendary Pokémon introduced in Generation 9 with a Grass typing that has a ton of inspiration for nicknames owing to its different forms.

Let's have a look at Ogerpon's origins and some of those nicknames.

**Please note**: at the time of writing, this may contain spoilers for the DLC but nothing connected to the storyline.

## Origins

Ogerpon is a green humanoid Pokémon with dark grey legs and two little leaves growing between its toes. In the DLC storyline, Ogerpon was said to live with a human centuries ago in Kitakami (where the Teal Mask DLC is based). Villagers shunned them due to their strange appearances but they blended in once they were wore masks, made by a local mask-maker. In fact, the masks made them famous but three greedy Pokémon called Okidogi, Munkidori, and Fezandipiti, stole them from Ogerpon in his cave and his human companion seemed to disappear in the aftermath. When Ogerpon returned, it attacked the trio and slayed them.

The villagers shunned Ogerpon once again, not knowing what had happened, and instead lionised the fallen three, naming them the "Loyal Three" and made a shrine for them. Ogerpon went back to its cave never to be seen my humans again (until you play the DLC of course). However, the Festival of Masks lived on and that's what drew Ogerpon out once again.

The four masks that the local mask-maker made for Ogerpon give allow it to take four different forms:

* When Ogerpon wears the Teal Mask, it transforms into its Teal Mask form, which remains a pure Grass-type.
* When Ogerpon wears the Wellspring Mask, it transforms into its Wellspring Mask form, which makes it a dual Grass/Water typing.
* When Ogerpon wears the Hearthflame Mask, it transforms into its Hearthflame Mask form, which makes it a dual Grass/Fire typing.
* When Ogerpon wears the Cornerstone Mask, it transforms into its Cornerstone Mask form, which makes it a dual Grass/Rock typing.

Name-wise, Ogerpon appears to be a portmanteau of ogre + <em>-pon</em>, a Japanese suffix added to names as a <q cite="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Ogerpon_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Name_origin">form of endearment</q>.

## Nicknames

My methodology for nicknames is as follows:

* I rank nicknames by lettered tiers: S, A, B, C, and D. S is the best and D is the worst.
* I may use generative AI for inspiration. I'll always mark these nicknames with an asterisk (\*) but they'll always be amended where necessary
* I'll usually list my inspiration for a nickname so you know where they came from

With all that said, let's look at those Ogerpon nicknames!

### S-Tier

* **Baby Spice/Ginger Spice/Scary Spice/Posh Spice/Sporty Spice** - I thought these would be good for a themed team and work with different masks (I know there were 5 people in the Spice Girls and 4 masks so you can be inventive)
* **Poncho** - a genius name I found on Reddit so full credit to [PurplePo8to](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonScarletViolet/comments/16kz4vv/comment/k0zy61w/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

### A-Tier

* **MF DOOM** - because of the masks, and just remember all caps when you spell the 'Mon name
* **Pebbles** - as Ogerpon is a girl and I couldn't name it Bam-Bam (the Flintstones character with the club), I went with Pebbles instead

### B-Tier

* **Green Giant** - it's ironic because Ogerpon *isn't* a giant at all!
* **Kate Moss** - because moss is a word associated with plants and grass types, Kate Moss is a woman, and a model so visually appealing, much like Ogerpon!
* **Ponyo** - popular nickname, based on the titular character from Studio Ghibli movie, Ponyo
* **Princess** - see "Fiona"
* **Majora** - based on The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask
* **Violet/Chachki** - [because of this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM3rgaRtVqo)
* **Shy Girl** - inspired by Shy Guy from the Mario universe
* **Handsome** - because she is!
* **Queenie** - so my mind went: King (from Tekken) > Queen > Queenie

### C-Tier

* **Cudgey Coo** - based on its ivy cudgel and the phrase "coochi-coochi-coo", often said to parents to their babies because they're so cute
* **Poison Ivy** - the ivy strikes again!
* **Maiden** - I thought this worked since Ogerpon is a girl
* **Chlorophyll** - chlorophyll is the green stuff that gives plants life and "phyll" is short for Phyllis, a woman's name
* **PonDeReplay** - Hey Mr. DJ, won't you turn the music up?
* **Samus** - because Samus wears a mask and she's a girl, right?
* **Masquerade** - <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masquerade_ball">a masquerade ball is an special kind of formal ball which many participants attend in costume wearing masks.</q>
* **Meta** - after Meta Knight, the masked villain from the Kirby universe

### D-Tier

* **Fiona** - another shunned ogre? Makes sense!
* **Jungle** - I dunno lol
* **Weapon** - Wea*PON*, geddit!?
* **Nippon** - Nippon is the Japanese name for Japan and... pon lol
* **Libre** - referencing [Lucha libre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucha_libre) and that fact that Libre means free and Ogerpon is "free" at the end of the DLC
