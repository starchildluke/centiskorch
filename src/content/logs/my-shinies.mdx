import pkmn from '../../data/shiny_pkmn.json';

<p>{frontmatter.description}</p>

I currently have over {Math.round(pkmn.length / 10) * 10} shinies which may not be visible as this page is a work in progress. I can only fit the sprite, species name, and nickname in the table but if you want to see more info about each shiny—including how I got it and what game it came from—you can [check out the JSON file](/json/shiny_pkmn.json) where all the data lives.

Note: if names are separated by a slash, it means I have more than one.
